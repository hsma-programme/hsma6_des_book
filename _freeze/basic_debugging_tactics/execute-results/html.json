There are a range of different approaches we can take. These include:\n\n1. Using simple `print()` statements.\n2. Using a function (e.g. `trace()`) to control the `print()` statements.\n3. Using the `logging` module.\n4. Tests.\n5. Event logging.\n\n## The model\n\nWhere code examples are provided, this chapter uses the model from the chapter \"[An Example SimPy Model](an_example_simpy_model.qmd)\".\n\n:::{.callout-tip}\nThroughout the code, anything new that's been added will be followed by the comment `##NEW` - so look out for that in the following code chunks.\n:::\n\nIn each of these examples, we will just run the model once.\n\n::: {#c6245fdc .cell execution_count=1}\n``` {.python .cell-code}\nclass g:\n    patient_inter = 5\n    mean_n_consult_time = 6\n    number_of_nurses = 1\n    sim_duration = 120\n    number_of_runs = 1  ##NEW - single run # <1>\n```\n:::\n\n\n1. Just run the model once.\n\n## Using simple `print()` statements\n\nTo get a running record of what is happening in your model, you can add `print()` statements at key points.\n\nFor example, we can add:\n\n* A print statement recording when each patient arrives.\n* A print statement recording when each patient is seen by the nurse (including how long they waited, and how long their consultation then was).\n\n:::{.callout-tip}\nFor another example using `print()` statements, see the \"[Reneging, Balking and Jockeying](reneging_balking_jockeying.qmd)\" chapter where they are used, for example, to record:\n\n::: {#bc8c8a33 .cell execution_count=2}\n``` {.python .cell-code}\nprint (f\"Patient {patient.id} reneged after waiting\",\n       f\"{patient.patience_nurse} minutes\")\n```\n:::\n\n\n:::\n\n### Coding the model\n\nWe will modify the `Model` class to add print statements within the `generator_patient_arrivals()` and `attend_clinic()` functions.\n\n::: {#450db09d .cell execution_count=3}\n``` {.python .cell-code}\ndef generator_patient_arrivals(self):\n    while True:\n        self.patient_counter += 1\n        p = Patient(self.patient_counter)\n\n        ##NEW - Print message stating patient ID and arrival time # <1>\n        print(f\"Patient {p.id} arrives at: {self.env.now:.3f}.\")\n\n        self.env.process(self.attend_clinic(p))\n        sampled_inter = random.expovariate(1.0 / g.patient_inter)\n        yield self.env.timeout(sampled_inter)\n\ndef attend_clinic(self, patient):\n    start_q_nurse = self.env.now\n    with self.nurse.request() as req:\n        yield req\n        end_q_nurse = self.env.now\n        patient.q_time_nurse = end_q_nurse - start_q_nurse\n        sampled_nurse_act_time = random.expovariate(1.0 /\n                                                    g.mean_n_consult_time)\n\n        ##NEW - Print message with patient wait and consultation length # <1>\n        print(\n          f\"Patient {patient.id} waits for {patient.q_time_nurse:.3f} \" +\n          f\"and is seen at {end_q_nurse}.

Here, we just demonstrate a simple implementation.\n\n### Coding the model\n\n#### Imports\n\nFirst, we need to update our imports.\n\n::: {#f65e2b51 .cell execution_count=12}\n``` {.python .cell-code}\nimport logging  ##NEW # <1>\nimport sys  ##NEW # <2>\nimport time  ##NEW # <3>\n\nimport simpy\nimport random\nimport pandas as pd\n```\n:::\n\n\n1. Add `logging` which we will use to create logs.\n2. Add `sys` which is required when setting up the handler for logging to the console.\n3. Add `time` which we will use is it is desired to save logs to a file with the current date and time.\n\n#### SimLogger class\n\nNext, we will create a new class called `SimLogger`. This accepts three inputs when setting up:\n\n* `log_to_console` - which determines whether to print log messages.\n* `log_to_file` - which determines whether to save the log to a file.\n* `file_path` - if saving to file, the path to use.\n\nThe class configures handlers for logging (`_configure_logging()`), and then has a `log()` method which will be used to save messages to the log in our model.\n\n::: {#f62b366b .cell execution_count=13}\n``` {.python .cell-code}\n##NEW\nclass SimLogger:\n    \"\"\"\n    Provides log of events as the simulation runs.\n    \"\"\"\n    def __init__(self, log_to_console=False, log_to_file=False,\n                file_path=(\"../outputs/logs/\" +\n                            f\"{time.strftime('%Y-%m-%d_%H-%M-%S')}.log\")\n      ): # <1>\n        \"\"\"\n        Initialise the Logger class.\n\n        Arguments:\n            log_to_console (boolean):\n                Whether to print log messages to the console.\n            log_to_file (boolean):\n                Whether to save log to a file.\n            file_path (str):\n                Path to save log to file.

Set up for the `SimLogger` class which accepts three inputs, and will call the `_configure_logging()` method\n2. This method configures the loggers, setting up appropriate handlers depending on whether we are printing logs to the console, saving them to the file, or both.\n3. This is the equivalent to `print()` or `trace()` above.\n\n#### g class\n\nIn our `g` class, we will add an instance of the logging class.\n\n::: {#5f4aaf15 .cell execution_count=14}\n``` {.python .cell-code}\nclass g:\n    patient_inter = 5\n    mean_n_consult_time = 6\n    number_of_nurses = 1\n    sim_duration = 120\n    number_of_runs = 1  ##NEW - single run # <1>\n    ##NEW - instance of the SimLogger class # <2>\n    logger = SimLogger(log_to_console = True,\n                       log_to_file = True,\n                       file_path = \"./outputs/example_log.log\")\n```\n:::\n\n\n1.

They can also then be used for building animated visuals of the flow of entities through our model.\n\nAs this is a more involved approach, it has been placed in its own chapter [here](event_logging.qmd).\n\n",
