These are known as coding **paradigms**.\n\nIn functional programming, you write **functions** that are (ideally) designed to do one thing and do it well.\n\nYou then use these functions in some sort of sequence to achieve what you're trying to do.\n\nThis can make a lot of sense for a lot of data analysis and data science workflows.\n\nIn comparison, in object oriented programming (OOP) everything is centred around objects that have their own:\n\n- Attributes (variables that belong to them), and-\n- Methods (which are what functions are called when they belong to objects).\n\n**Objects** are created as **instances** of **classes**.\n\nClasses are essentially generalised blueprints for how certain types of objects should work!\n\nThis can be really useful in situations where you have either:\n\n- A lot of logic that makes sense to attach and organise with the thing that uses that logic (like a process)\n- A need to make copies of a very similar thing (like lots of patients to populate a model)\n\nLet’s look at an example.\n\nLet’s say we want to write code that defines how an ambulance works.\n\nThere will be properties the ambulance has. Things like:\n\n- The organisation it belongs to.\n- The registration number.\n- Whether a patient is currently on board.\n- Whether the siren is currently going off.\n\nThere will also be things the ambulance does:\n\n- Driving.\n- Parking.\n- Having patients loaded into it / out of it.\n- Switching the siren on and off.\n\nIn Object Oriented Programming, the things it **has** are known as **attributes** and the things it *does* are *methods*.\n\n:::\n\n\nSpecifically, we’re going to have 4 different classes: g, entity, model, and trial.\n\nWhile object oriented code can feel a bit cumbersome for small models, following the same sort of pattern each time makes it really easy to keep track of what your model is doing. It also makes it a lot easier to expand and modify your model over time.\n\nThe other benefit is that you will find other models from people who have done the HSMA course are likely to have a similar structure - so you should find it easier to read, reuse and tweak their models too!\n\n:::{.callout-note}\nEven among people using an object oriented approach, you will find some variations.\n\nAgain, there's nothing wrong with that!\n\nAnother common pattern you may come across in time is the Scenario, entity, model approach with single_run and multiple_run functions that don't exist inside a class.\n\nOver time, you'll likely find a style used by someone else that you find particularly easy to follow and you want to adopt and adapt.\n\n:::\n\n**g Class**\n\nThis is a special class that will store our global level parameters for the model.\n\nUnlike most OOP cases, we won’t create an instance of this class (hence the lower case) - we’ll just refer to the blueprint directly.\n\n**Entity**\n\nThis class will represent our entity.\n\nAn entity could be a customer, a passenger, etc., but often in our healthcare models, our entities will be patients.\n\nEntities will carry with them information that we can record to and / or read from (e.g. an ID, how long they spent queuing, their condition etc).\n\nIf we had more than one entity, we’d need a class for each.\n\nMultiple entities could be different types of patients - e.g. trauma patients and non-trauma patients.\n\n**Model**\n\nThis is the big one that represents the system that we are modelling.\n\nThis could be a phone helpline, a clinic, an emergency department, an airport terminal, a healthcare clinic that runs appointments - many processes are suitable.\n\nIt’ll have our generators, our entity journeys and more, and it’s where our SimPy environment (where everything lives) will be kept.\n\n\n**Trial**\n\nThis class will represent a batch of runs of our simulation, and will have methods to run a trial, extract results etc.\n\n## Class breakdown\n\nLet's look at the purpose and recommended structure of each class in a bit more detail.\n\nHere, the example code given relates to a customer support helpline. Customers call a helpline, wait on hold until a customer support agent is ready to speak to them, speak to the agent for a period of time, and then the call ends and the agent connects to the next person who is waiting on hold. If there is no-one on hold at the time, the agent will get a break until someone else arrives!\n\n### g class\n\nThe g Class stores our global parameter values for the model so we can easily change aspects of the model to test scenarios.  This includes:\n\n- Values to define inter-arrival time distributions (eg mean, standard deviation etc).\n- Values to define activity time distributions (eg mean, standard deviation etc).\n- Number of each resource.\n- Duration of simulation runs.\n- Number of runs in a trial.\n\nWe do not create an instance of g class.  Instead, we refer to it directly when we need to access something in it.\n\n:::{.callout-note}\n#### Example g class\n\n::: {#e9bc34a3 .cell execution_count=1}\n``` {.python .cell-code}\nclass g:\n    time_units_between_customer_arrivals = 5\n    mean_customer_service_time = 6\n    number_of_customer_support_agents = 1\n    sim_duration = 1440\n    number_of_runs = 10\n```\n:::\n\n\n:::\n\n### Entity class\n\nThe entity class represents our entity in the model - which, for healthcare models, will often be patients.\n\nWe can store attributes here that entities carry with them that we may want to access (think of a person carrying a clipboard with them with information on it).\n\nIn a simple model, an entity may just carry their ID and how long they spent queuing for a resource (once known).  But more advanced models could store things like their condition, their priority, probability of going down path x, etc.\n\n:::{.callout-note}\n#### Example entity class\n\n::: {#7f2ad38b .cell execution_count=2}\n``` {.python .cell-code}\nclass Customer:\n    def __init__(self, p_id):\n        self.id = p_id\n        self.queue_time_customer_support_agent = 0\n```\n:::\n\n\n:::\n\n### Model class\n\nThe Model Class represents the system we are modelling - this might be a clinic, for example.  As such, there’s a lot more to unpack here, so let’s take this bit by bit.\n\nFirst, we’ll look at the constructor for our model.\n\nThe constructor will set up:\n\n- A SimPy Environment (basically where everything lives).\n- An entity counter (which we’ll use to give entities - such as patients - a simple ID).\n- The resources we need (for example, our nurses).\n- A DataFrame to store per-entity results in a single run of the model.\n- Attributes to store things like how long the entities queued for each activity.\n\nWhat the constructor sets up doesn't have to be limited to these things - anything relating to the system as a whole that makes sense to store here could be included.\n\n#### DES generator - arrivals of entities to the system\n\nWithin the Model Class we have a **generator function** that will represent our DES generator for entities **arriving into our process**.\n\nHere’s basically how it works:\n\n*KEEP REPEATING THE FOLLOWING FOREVER (until the simulation stops running):*\n\n1. Increment the counter to get ID for next entity.\n2. Create a new entity and give them that ID.\n3. Start up an instance of the generator function for their journey through the process and chuck them in it.\n4. Sample the time until the next entity arrives.\n5. FREEZE this function until that time elapses.\n6. Return to 1.\n\n#### DES Generator - the entity journey\n\nNow, let’s look at the big one.  The other generator function - the one that represents an entity’s journey through the system (this is the one we lobbed the new entities generated by the previous generator).\n\nHere’s how this works:\n\n1. Record time started queuing for first activity.\n2. Request resource for first activity.\n3. Wait until resource is free.\n4. Once resource is free, grab the resource and keep hold of the resource until finished with them.  Record time finished queuing and calculate queue time.\n5. Sample how long will spend in this activity.\n6. FREEZE this instance of the function until that time elapses (freezing the resource with it, so it’s not available to anyone else).\n7. If there’s another activity, do the same again for that one.  If not, end (and therefore entity leaves the model).\n\n#### Running the model\n\nFinally, we need a run method in our Model class.  Basically, the run method will:\n\n- Start up our DES generators (our arrival points) - we only have one here.\n- Tell the simulation to run for the duration specified in g Class.\n- Call the calculate run results method in the previous slide.\n- Print out the run number with the patient-level results from this run.\n\n\n:::{.callout-note}\n#### Full Example model class\n\n::: {#ffa8b67e .cell execution_count=3}\n``` {.python .cell-code}\nclass Model:\n    # Constructor to set up the model for a run.

Once the run has\n        # completed, we grab out the stored run results (just mean queuing time\n        # here) and store it against the run number in the trial results\n        # dataframe.\n        for run in range(g.number_of_runs):\n            my_model = Model(run)\n            my_model.run()\n\n            self.df_trial_results.loc[run] = [my_model.mean_queue_time_support_agent]\n\n        # Once the trial (ie all runs) has completed, print the final results\n        self.print_trial_results()\n```\n:::\n\n\n:::\n\nWe can, of course, then take the means over the runs in the trial to get the average predicted queuing time etc. - and we should probably do that in a separate method in the Trial class.\n\n",
