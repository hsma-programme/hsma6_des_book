These attributes can then be read when making decisions in the pathway, like where to go in a branch, or which distribution to sample from for an activity time instead.\n\nHowever, it's perhaps not always clear cut! For example, our 'seriously injured' and 'mildly injured' patients above may have different arrival patterns throughout the day, with the seriously injured patients arriving during the morning and evening rush hours, and the mildly injured having a peak in the early evening. Again, we could go about this in multiple ways:\n\n- we could check the simulation time, then look up the probability of them being seriously injured vs mildly injured at that point in time (relating it back to real-world time), and sample accordingly\n- we could use two generators, using the method described in the [variable arrival rates](modelling_variable_arrival_rates.qmd) chapter.\n\n## Multiple patient classes versus a single patient class\n\nSimilarly, when it comes to our patient classes, there are multiple ways we could handle it.\n\nWe could build multiple separate patient classes. For example, let's imagine we have trauma patients and non-trauma patients in a system. A diagram of the system is shown below.\n\n![](assets/2025-01-24-10-02-34.png)\n\nIn this system, patients have a shared first step, but then move to very separate pathways. We have no need to track the waiting time for a 'stabilisation waiting area' for a non-trauma patient, as they will never use that resource.\n\nConsequently, we may opt to do the following.\n\n::: {#8f43b1dc .cell execution_count=1}\n``` {.python .cell-code}\nclass TraumaPatient:\n    def __init__(self, p_id):\n        self.id = p_id\n\n        self.q_time_recep = 0\n\n        self.q_time_stabilisation = 0\n        self.q_time_treatment = 0\n\nclass NonTraumaPatient:\n    def __init__(self, p_id):\n        self.id = p_id\n\n        self.q_time_recep = 0\n\n        self.q_time_registration = 0\n        self.q_time_examination = 0\n        self.q_time_treatment = 0\n```\n:::\n\n\nWe could use the concept of inheritance to have a main patient class, then have multiple 'child' classes who inherit the properties of the parent class while also recording their own special attributes, with the different processes generating the relevant patient type. You can read more about inheritance in [this chapter of the HSMA Python Book](https://python.hsma.co.uk/inheritance.html). We may opt to do this in cases where our patients share a few attributes, but not all of them.\n\n::: {#3c15f1fe .cell execution_count=2}\n``` {.python .cell-code}\nclass Patient(self, p_id):\n    # Here we can set up any attributes that are common across all of our\n    # patient types\n    self.id = p_id\n    self.q_time_recep = 0\n\nclass TraumaPatient(Patient):\n    def __init__(self, p_id):\n        # This calls the constructor of the parent (super), and passes the\n        # patient ID across to it\n        super().__init__(p_id)\n\n        self.q_time_stabilisation = 0\n        self.q_time_treatment = 0\n\nclass NonTraumaPatient(Patient):\n    def __init__(self, p_id):\n        super().__init__(p_id)\n\n        self.q_time_registration = 0\n        self.q_time_examination = 0\n        self.q_time_treatment = 0\n```\n:::\n\n\nHowever, if our patients are following the same or a sufficiently similar route that means that the attributes of the patient classes don't substantially change, it is often simpler to add an additional attribute that we set when initialising a patient to track their 'type', allowing us to then filter and subset patient groups in our results. This is similar to what is done in the [priority resources](priority_based_queueing.qmd) chapter.\n\nIn this case, let's imagine we have two patients of different severities. Patients of a higher severity arrive less frequently but use resources for longer. We may set this up in the following way.\n\n::: {#26840763 .cell execution_count=3}\n``` {.python .cell-code}\nclass Patient:\n    def __init__(self, p_id, severity):\n        self.id = p_id\n\n        self.severity = severity\n\n        self.q_time_recep = 0\n        self.q_time_doctor = 0\n```\n:::\n\n\nThis means that when the patient is set up, it requires two attributes - the ID, as we have done throughout the book so far, and the severity.\n\nThis approach is itself quite flexible - you could sample the severity when generating the patient, or choose to make the severity a parameter that is passed through in your generator method, allowing you to create patients of a given severity or type in that way. This is demonstrated in the [next chapter](example_multiple_entity_types_similar_pathways.qmd).\n\n",
