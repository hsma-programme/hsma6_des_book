Evidence suggests that hospital processes, rather than clinical judgement, are responsible for this spike in admissions or discharge in the immediate period before a patient breaches the standard.\"\n\n![](https://thepsc.co.uk/downloads/Screenshot_2023-03-06_at_09.32.37.png)\nSource: NHS England analysis of Secondary Uses Services (SUS) data, via [The PSC](https://thepsc.co.uk/news-insights/entry/reaffirming-the-nhs-4-hour-ae-target-why-it-matters)\n\nIf the target was removed, would this result in a change in behaviour? How might the predictions of our model be affected by this?\n:::\n\n## Throughput\n\nThroughput refers to the % of people entering our system who have left by the time our model stops running.\n\nA very low throughput suggests a severe bottleneck somewhere in the system.\n\nThis can be a useful measure to track as a quick way of assessing whether different scenarios are leading to severe bottlenecks, but it is not that useful as a standalone measure.\n\n",
