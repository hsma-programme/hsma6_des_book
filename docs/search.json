    "section": "1.4 Key DES Terminology",
    "text": "1.4 Key DES Terminology\n\nEntities are the things that are flowing through the sequential processes in the model (eg patients, test results, callers on a phone)\nGenerators are the way in which entities enter the model and come into being (eg arriving at ED by ambulance, self-presenting, referral from GP)\nInter-Arrival Times specify the time between entities being generated in the generators (ie the time between arrivals into the modelled system)\nActivities (sometimes referred to as Servers) are the bits of process that the entities are queuing up for (eg triaged, seen at reception, speak to doctor etc)\nActivity Time represents the amount of time it takes for an activity to happen to an entity - this is normally stochastic (random) and drawn from a distribution for each entity (eg time spent with nurse, time to be treated etc)\nResources are the “stuff” and / or “staff” required for an activity to happen to an entity (eg nurse to triage, bed for patient, consultation room for GP to see patient etc, X-Ray machine and Radiographer to be free for X-Ray etc). Important - resources may be shared between activities (eg the same nurse may be required to run multiple activities in our model, or even things we haven’t explicitly modelled)\nQueues hold entities that are waiting for an activity. Entities wait in a queue until the activity has both the capacity and all required resources.\nSinks are how entities leave the model (the bit of system we’re modelling)\n\n\n1.4.1 Entities\nEach entity may have certain “attributes” that it “carries with them” to help determine its journey through the modelled system. For example :\n\nwhether it goes down path A or B\nhow long it spends in an activity\nits priority in a queue for an activity\n\nThere may also be more than one type of entity in a model at the same time. For example, patients in a clinic, their test results, and phone calls into the clinic are all entities that we may want to capture when modelling the clinic.\n\n\n\n1.4.2 Generators and Inter-Arrival\nA generator creates new entities to bring into the system. The rate at which new entities are generated is determined by an inter-arrival time.\nThe inter-arrival time determines the time between one entity being generated, and the next one being generated.\nInter-arrival times may be fixed, but are typically sampled (drawn) stochastically (randomly) from a distribution to capture variability (even if the variability is small).\nAn Exponential Distribution is often used to sample inter-arrival times. More than one distribution may be used for the same generator (e.g. for different times of the day, day of week etc). You may also (often) have more than one generator in a system.\n\n\n\n1.4.3 Queues\nEach activity in a Discrete Event Simulation has an associated queue. The queue holds entities whilst they wait for the activity to become available for them.\nEach queue has a queuing policy. This determines the order in which entities are released from the queue into the activity. The two most common queuing policies are:\n\nFirst In First Out (FIFO) : entities are seen in the order they arrive. This is the default.\nPriority-based : entities are seen according to some priority attribute. Ties often resolved using FIFO\n\n\n\n\n1.4.4 Activities and Activity Times\nEach activity in a DES describes a process – this may be a simple atomic task, or a set of tasks bundled together. For an activity to take place, it needs :\n\nAn entity (drawn from the queue)\nThe required type and number of resource to be available\n\nOnce the above conditions have been met, the activity begins. The entity, and the resource(s) are then locked in place for an amount of time – the Activity Time. The resource(s) cannot be used elsewhere until the activity time has passed.\nActivity times may be fixed, but are typically sampled stochastically from a distribution.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\nThe common distribution for process times is the Log Normal distributions. However, Exponential Distributions can be a good starting point, as it’s easy to change the “mean” when playing around with things. You can then change to something like a Log Normal once you (and the stakeholders) are happy\n\n\n\n\n1.4.5 Resources\nResources are needed to undertake activities. An activity may require just a single resource, more than one resource of the same type, or multiple resources of different types.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\nAn activity may not require a resource at all, but think carefully to ensure that it really is either “resourceless” or there is no constraint on the resource (and so doesn’t need to be modelled).\nResources can include - “staff” (e.g. doctors, nurses, officers etc) - “stuff” (beds, test equipment, detention cell etc)\n\n\nResources can (and often are) shared across a system, so may be required for more than one activity. Therefore, a resource drain in one part of the system can affect another.\nAll required resources are needed for an activity to take place.\nIn some activities, having optional additional resource may speed up the activity (though rarely linearly).\n\n\n\n1.4.6 Sinks\nSinks are how entities leave the system, or part of the system, being modelled. Sinks might include :\n\nan entity physically leaving a system (e.g. discharge from hospital)\nan entity no longer existing (e.g. death, use of sample, end of telephone call)\nan entity no longer needing to access activities that we’re interested in (e.g. they leave the bit of the system that we’re modelling)\n\nThe most important thing to remember about a sink is that it doesn’t necessarily represent an entity leaving the system entirely.\nFor example, the scope of your model may only cover the triage aspect of an Emergency Department. Therefore, a valid sink might be placed after their triage - they’ve left the scope of our model\n\n\n\n1.4.7 Branching Paths\nReal world systems (and the models of those systems) are rarely linear. Often, different things will happen to different entities. In a Discrete Event Simulation, this means different entities flowing to different activities, or different sinks.\nWe might differentiate based on :\n\nan attribute of the patient (e.g. patients with a higher priority value flow through a different set of activities)\nprobability (e.g. we know that approx 60% of these patients end up being admitted, so we’ll randomly select for them to be admitted 60% of the time)\ntime (e.g. after a certain time of day, entities flow through a different set of activities)\n\n\n\n\n1.4.8 Outputs\nAs with any type of model, it’s important to think about what outputs you need your DES model to generate to answer your modelling questions. As a DES model is used to model queuing and resourcing problems, typical DES model outputs include average, min, max, xth percentile of :\n\ntime entities are in system\nqueue length and duration for queues of interest\nrate of resource utilisation (ie % of time a resource is in use for activities in the model)\nprobability of exceeding a defined queue length / queue time / resource utilisation threshold (e.g. 4 hour wait in ED, overcrowding thresholds)",

In models of pathways where people arrive for a service, this will likely be minutes (seconds is too much, and hours is probably not enough, unless all the processes are slow). But we may have pathways where we measure time in days or weeks (e.g. referral pathways).\nFor example, in an ED model, our time units may represent minutes.

When we call the function again, it runs again, from scratch.\nGenerator functions remember where they were and what they did when control is passed back (they retain their local state), so that they can continue where they left off, and can be used as powerful iterators (for and while loops are other examples of iterators).\nThis is very useful where we want state to be maintained, so we can remember how long until we generate the next entity, or where an entity is in a pathway…\nLet’s look at a very simple example of a generator function to see how they work.\n\nIn SimPy, we use Generator Functions in two different places :\nTo model the DES generators (arrival points) To model the individual journey of each entity\nLet’s imagine we are modelling patients in a patient pathway.\nFor 1, the generator function basically creates a patient, sets them off on their pathway, then freezes in place for an amount of time representing the inter-arrival time to the next patient. Then it does it all over again.\nFor 2, the generator function requests a resource and freezes until that resource is available (the queue). When the resource is available it freezes in place for an amount of time with it (the activity). It will then either move on to the next activity (and request the resource for it, as above) or end if there are no further activities.",

This includes :\n\nValues to define inter-arrival time distributions (eg mean, standard deviation etc)\nValues to define activity time distributions (eg mean, standard deviation etc)\nNumber of each resource\nDuration of simulation runs\nNumber of runs in a trial\n\nWe do not create an instance of g class.

But more advanced models could store things like their condition, their priority, probability of going down path x, etc.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExample entity class\n\n\n\n\nclass Customer:\n    def __init__(self, p_id):\n        self.id = p_id\n        self.queue_time_customer_support_agent = 0\n\n\n\n\n\n4.1.3 Model Class\nThe Model Class represents the system we are modelling - this might be a clinic, for example. As such, there’s a lot more to unpack here, so let’s take this bit by bit.\nFirst, we’ll look at the constructor for our model.\nThe constructor will set up - a SimPy Environment (basically where everything lives) - an entity counter (which we’ll use to give entities - such as patients - a simple ID) - the resources we need (for example, our nurses) - a DataFrame to store per-entity results in a single run of the model - attributes to store things like how long the entities queued for each activity\nWhat the constructor sets up doesn’t have to be limited to these things - anything relating to the system as a whole that makes sense to store here could be included.\n\n4.1.3.1 DES generator - arrivals of entities to the system\nWithin the Model Class we have a generator function that will represent our DES generator for entities arriving into our process.\nHere’s basically how it works:\nKEEP REPEATING THE FOLLOWING FOREVER (until the simulation stops running) :\n\nIncrement the counter to get ID for next entity\nCreate a new entity and give them that ID\nStart up an instance of the generator function for their journey through the process and chuck them in it\nSample the time until the next entity arrives\nFREEZE this function until that time elapses\nReturn to 1\n\n\n\n4.1.3.2 DES Generator - the entity journey\nNow, let’s look at the big one. The other generator function - the one that represents an entity’s journey through the system (this is the one we lobbed the new entities generated by the previous generator).\nHere’s how this works :\n\nRecord time started queuing for first activity\nRequest resource for first activity\nWait until resource is free\nOnce resource is free, grab the resource and keep hold of the resource until finished with them. Record time finished queuing and calculate queue time.\nSample how long will spend in this activity.\nFREEZE this instance of the function until that time elapses (freezing the resource with it, so it’s not available to anyone else)\nIf there’s another activity, do the same again for that one. If not, end (and therefore entity leaves the model).\n\n\n\n4.1.3.3 Running the model\nFinally, we need a run method in our Model class. Basically, the run method will\n\nstart up our DES generators (our arrival points) - we only have one here.\ntell the simulation to run for the duration specified in g Class.\ncall the calculate run results method in the previous slide.\nprint out the run number with the patient-level results from this run.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFull Example model class\n\n\n\n\nclass Model:\n    # Constructor to set up the model for a run.

Let’s start by looking at the init method - the list of things that are set up when we create an instance of our model class.\nFirst, we have added in a new type of resource - a receptionist, pulling in the number of receptionist to create from our g class.\nWe’ve then added two additional fields to our results dataframe - how long each patient queues for a receptionist, and how long each patient spends with the receptionist.\nFinally, we add in an attribute that we will use to store the mean average queuing time for receptionists across the whole model.\n\ndef __init__(self, run_number):\n        # Create a SimPy environment in which everything will live\n        self.env = simpy.Environment()\n\n        # Create a patient counter (which we'll use as a patient ID)\n        self.patient_counter = 0\n\n        # Create our resources\n        self.receptionist = simpy.Resource(\n            self.env, capacity=g.number_of_receptionists\n        ) ##NEW\n        self.nurse = simpy.Resource(self.env, capacity=g.number_of_nurses)\n\n        # Store the passed in run number\n        self.run_number = run_number\n\n        # Create a new Pandas DataFrame that will store some results against\n        # the patient ID (which we'll use as the index).\n        self.results_df = pd.DataFrame()\n        self.results_df[\"Patient ID\"] = [1]\n        self.results_df[\"Q Time Recep\"] = [0.0] ##NEW\n        self.results_df[\"Time with Recep\"] = [0.0] ##NEW\n        self.results_df[\"Q Time Nurse\"] = [0.0]\n        self.results_df[\"Time with Nurse\"] = [0.0]\n        self.results_df.set_index(\"Patient ID\", inplace=True)\n\n        # Create an attribute to store the mean queuing times across this run of\n        # the model\n        self.mean_q_time_recep = 0 ##NEW\n        self.mean_q_time_nurse = 0\n\nOur generator_patient_arrivals method remains unchanged as nothing has been tweaked about how patients turn up to the system.\nOur attend_clinic method is where we make the actual change to the process the patient goes through.\nNote that we have a new line with an indended section inside it.\n\nwith self.receptionist.request() as req:\n\nEverything at one level of indentation within this now relates to the use of the receptionist resource.\n\n # A generator function that represents the pathway for a patient going\n    # through the clinic.\n    # The patient object is passed in to the generator function so we can\n    # extract information from / record information to it\n    def attend_clinic(self, patient):\n        ##NEW - added reception activity\n        start_q_recep = self.env.now\n\n        with self.receptionist.request() as req:\n            yield req\n\n            end_q_recep = self.env.now\n\n            patient.q_time_recep = end_q_recep - start_q_recep\n\n            sampled_recep_act_time = random.expovariate(\n                1.0 / g.mean_reception_time\n            )\n\n            self.results_df.at[patient.id, \"Q Time Recep\"] = (\n                 patient.q_time_recep\n            )\n            self.results_df.at[patient.id, \"Time with Recep\"] = (\n                 sampled_recep_act_time\n            )\n\n            yield self.env.timeout(sampled_recep_act_time)\n\n        # Here's where the patient finishes with the receptionist, and starts\n        # queuing for the nurse\n\n        # Record the time the patient started queuing for a nurse\n        start_q_nurse = self.env.now\n\n        # This code says request a nurse resource, and do all of the following\n        # block of code with that nurse resource held in place (and therefore\n        # not usable by another patient)\n        with self.nurse.request() as req:\n            # Freeze the function until the request for a nurse can be met.\n            # The patient is currently queuing.\n            yield req\n\n            # When we get to this bit of code, control has been passed back to\n            # the generator function, and therefore the request for a nurse has\n            # been met.

Let’s pull that out:\n\nprint(g.prob_seeing_doctor)\n\n0.6\n\n\nThe code in the Model class tests whether the number generated by the random number generator is below the threshold we’ve set of seeing the doctor. If it is, the indented code where we actually see the doctor will be run for that patient. If it is not, that bit is bypassed - which in this case means they’ve reached the end of their journey and leave the system (a sink).\n\nfor i in range(10):\n  random_number = random.uniform(0,1)\n  is_below_threshold = random_number &lt; g.prob_seeing_doctor\n\n  if is_below_threshold:\n    print(f\"Random number {random_number:.2f} is LOWER than threshold ({g.prob_seeing_doctor}). \" +\n    \"Doctor code is triggered.\")\n  else:\n    print(f\"Random number {random_number:.2f} is HIGHER than threshold ({g.prob_seeing_doctor}). \" +\n    \"Doctor code is **not** triggered.\")\n\nRandom number 0.51 is LOWER than threshold (0.6). Doctor code is triggered.\nRandom number 0.03 is LOWER than threshold (0.6). Doctor code is triggered.\nRandom number 0.20 is LOWER than threshold (0.6). Doctor code is triggered.\nRandom number 0.65 is HIGHER than threshold (0.6). Doctor code is **not** triggered.\nRandom number 0.54 is LOWER than threshold (0.6).

Doctor code is triggered.\nRandom number 0.81 is HIGHER than threshold (0.6). Doctor code is **not** triggered.\n\n\nIf we run this code a hundred thousand times and plot the results, we can start to see the pattern emerging despite the random element of the number generator.\n\nimport plotly.express as px\nimport pandas as pd\nimport numpy as np\n\nrandom_vals = [random.uniform(0,1) for i in range(100000)]\n\nrandom_vals_df = pd.DataFrame({\"value\" :random_vals})\n\nrandom_vals_df['threshold'] = np.where(random_vals_df[\"value\"]&lt;0.6, 'below', 'above')\n\nfig = px.histogram(random_vals_df, color=\"threshold\")\n\nfig.update_traces(xbins=dict(\n        start=0.0,\n        end=1.0,\n        size=0.1\n    ),\n    marker_line_width=1,marker_line_color=\"black\")\n\n\nfig.show()\n\n                                                \n\n\nSo for every 1000 patients, roughly 600 will see a doctor, and roughly 400 will leave the system straight after seeing the nurse.\n\n\n7.1.3.4 The calculate_run_results method\nIn this method, we just add an additional step to measure the mean time spent queueing for a doctor across all patients in this run.\n\n# This method calculates results over a single run.

You should give them mean results as a minimum, but you may consider providing additional results too.\nYou also need to calculate and provide them with the mean queuing times across the trial (eg mean queue for registration across all runs, for GP etc - so four numbers that you would report). You’ll need a new method in your Trial class to calculate this. You should find this a helpful output, as it’ll help you compare scenarios easily. Report these means to 1 decimal place.",

    "text": "9.2 Implementing the warm-up period\nImplementing a warm up period in SimPy is really easy.\nWe just simply check the current time whenever we go to calculate / store a result, and see if it’s beyond the warm up period. If it is, we do it. If it’s not, we don’t.\nLet’s look at an example. This is a slightly amended version of the model of patients coming in for a nurse consultation with a few tweaks (longer duration, more runs, added trial results calculation)\nWe’re going to assume this is a system that’s open 24 hours - let’s imagine this is a triage function at an emergency department.\nI’ve marked the bits I’ve added to include warm up with ##NEW\n\n9.2.1 The g class\nFirst we add in a new parameter - the length of the warm-up period.\nHere, the sim duration has been set to 2880, and the warm-up-period to half of this (1440). You don’t need to stick to this pattern - your warm-up could even be longer than your results collection if you want!\n\n# Class to store global parameter values.\nclass g:\n    # Inter-arrival times\n    patient_inter = 5\n\n    # Activity times\n    mean_n_consult_time = 6\n\n    # Resource numbers\n    number_of_nurses = 1\n\n    # Simulation meta parameters\n    sim_duration = 2880\n    warm_up_period = 1440 ##NEW - this will be in addition to the sim_duration\n    number_of_runs = 100\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\nIf you find it easier to keep track of, you could define your warm-up like this instead.\n\nresults_collection_period = 2880\nwarm_up_period = 1440\ntotal_sim_duration = results_collection_period + warm_up_period\n\n\n\n\n\n9.2.2 The patient class\nOur patient class is unchanged.\n\n\n9.2.3 The model class\nIn the model class, the ‘attend_clinic’ method changes.\nWe look at the current elapsed simulation time with the attribute self.env.now\nThen, whenever a patient attends the clinic and is using a nurse resource, we check whether the current simulation time is later than the number of time units we’ve set as our warm-up.\n\n9.2.3.1 The attend_clinic method\n\n# Generator function representing pathway for patients attending the\n# clinic.\ndef attend_clinic(self, patient):\n    # Nurse consultation activity\n    start_q_nurse = self.env.now\n\n    with self.nurse.request() as req:\n        yield req\n\n        end_q_nurse = self.env.now\n\n        patient.q_time_nurse = end_q_nurse - start_q_nurse\n\n        ##NEW - this checks whether the warm up period has passed before\n        # adding any results\n        if self.env.now &gt; g.warm_up_period:\n            self.results_df.at[patient.id, \"Q Time Nurse\"] = (\n                patient.q_time_nurse\n            )\n\n        sampled_nurse_act_time = random.expovariate(1.0 /\n                                                    g.mean_n_consult_time)\n\n        yield self.env.timeout(sampled_nurse_act_time)\n\nFor example, if the simulation time is at 840 and our warm_up is 1440, this bit of code - which adds the queuing time for this patient to our records - won’t run:\n\nself.results_df.at[patient.id, \"Q Time Nurse\"] = (\n    patient.q_time_nurse\n)\n\nHowever, if the simulation time is 1680, for example, it will.\n\n\n\n9.2.4 the calculate_run_results method\nAs we now won’t count the first patient, we need to remove the dummy first patient result entry we created when we set up the dataframe.\n\n# Method to calculate and store results over the run\ndef calculate_run_results(self):\n    self.results_df.drop([1], inplace=True) ##NEW\n\n    self.mean_q_time_nurse = self.results_df[\"Q Time Nurse\"].mean()\n\n\n9.2.4.1 The run method\nNext we need to tweak the duration of our model to reflect the combination of the period we want to collect results for and the warm-up period.\n\n# Method to run a single run of the simulation\ndef run(self):\n    # Start up DES generators\n    self.env.process(self.generator_patient_arrivals())\n\n    # Run for the duration specified in g class\n    ##NEW - we need to tell the simulation to run for the specified duration\n    # + the warm up period if we still want the specified duration in full\n    self.env.run(until=(g.sim_duration + g.warm_up_period))\n\n    # Calculate results over the run\n    self.calculate_run_results()\n\n    # Print patient level results for this run\n    print (f\"Run Number {self.run_number}\")\n    print (self.results_df)\n\n\n\n\n9.2.5 The Trial class\nOur trial class is unchanged.",

This ensure it takes priority over any patients\n        # (whose priority values start at 1).  But it also means that the\n        # nurse won't go on a break until they've finished with the current\n        # patient\n        with self.nurse.request(priority=-1) as req:\n            yield req\n\n            print (f\"{self.env.now:.2f}: The nurse is now on a break and will be back at\",\n                    f\"{(self.env.now + g.unav_time_nurse):.2f}\")\n\n            # Freeze with the nurse held in place for the unavailability\n            # time (ie duration of the nurse's break).  Here, both the\n            # duration and frequency are fixed, but you could randomly\n            # sample them from a distribution too if preferred.\n            yield self.env.timeout(g.unav_time_nurse)\n\n\n\n11.2.3.2 The run method\nIn our run method, we now start up the obstruct_nurse process in addition to the generator_patient_arrivals process.\n\ndef run(self):\n    # Start up DES generators\n    self.env.process(self.generator_patient_arrivals())\n    ##NEW - we also need to start up the obstructor generator now too\n    self.env.process(self.obstruct_nurse())\n\n    # Run for the duration specified in g class\n    self.env.run(until=(g.sim_duration + g.warm_up_period))\n\n    # Calculate results over the run\n    self.calculate_run_results()\n\n    return self.results_df\n\n\n\n\n11.2.4 The Trial class\nThe trial class is unchanged.",

    "text": "Tip\n\n\n\nThe good news is that we will be using some prewritten code to specify our lognormal, and all we will need to know to do this is the mean (average) time for our activity, and the standard deviation (a measure of how much the times vary across the dataset that python can calculate for us if given a list of activity times).\nHowever - it’s useful to have a bit more of an idea about what a lognormal is - so do have a read of the section below, but if you don’t quite get it just yet, don’t fret - just remember that lognormal is good for activity times in general, and the exponential distribution is good for inter-arrival times (the time between patients arriving).\n\n\n\n12.1.1 The normal distribution\nA normal distribution is a bell shaped curve that is symmetrical. It is defined by two parameters : μ (Mu) and σ (Sigma), which represent the mean and standard deviation of the distribution. So it’s easy to plug in such values from our own data.\n\n\n\n12.1.2 Logarithms\nBefore we proceed, let’s remind ourselves about something many of us learned at school (and then promptly forgot) : Logarithms.\nLogarithms are basically the opposite of exponentials.\nEffectively, lognormals relate to how many copies of one number multiply together to make another number.\nHow many 4s multiply together to make 64?\n4 x 4 x 4 = 64 We had to multiply 3 copies of the number 4 to get 64.\nThis means that the logarithm is 3.\nWe’d write this as \\[\nY = log_4(64) = 3\n\\]\n\n\n12.1.3 Bringing it all together - lognormal distributions\nHow does this relate to the distribution?\nWell, a Lognormal distribution is one in which the logarithm of the random variable we’re modelling is normally distributed.\nThis means that the the two parameters μ (Mu) and σ (Sigma) used to specify a Lognormal distribution do not represent the mean and standard deviation, unlike the normal distribution; rather, they represent what are known as the location and scale of the distribution respectively.\n\nμ (Mu) and σ (Sigma) represent the mean and standard deviation once the data in the log normal distribution has been transformed using logarithms.\n\nIt’s easy to get the mean and standard deviation of our data.\nIf we used the Normal distribution, we could do that.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWarning\n\n\n\nThe Normal distribution often isn’t good for activity times - it allows negative values - activity distributions are rarely symmetrical - they’re more likely to be a bit ‘wonky’ (skewed), with just a few activities being much longer\n\n\nThe probalm is we can’t just give a Lognormal distribution the mean and standard deviation, because in a Lognormal distribution, the mean and standard deviation of our data is represented in the underlying normal distribution not the Lognormal distribution (remember, it’s the logarithms of the values that are normally distributed).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\nSo what do we do?\nWe need to convert our mean and standard deviation values (that we get from our real world data) into Mu and Sigma for a Lognormal distribution.\nThis is the key bit you need to understand!",

If they waited, we’ll proceed as before. If they reneged, then they won’t see the nurse, and we’ll record that they reneged - We’ll add the number of patients that reneged to our outputs from each run, and take the average number of patients who reneged per run over the trial.",

    "text": "14.2 Balking\nFor balking, there are two different ways in which balking can occur (and both could occur in the same model) :\n\nAn entity may choose not to join a queue because it is too long for their preferences / needs\nAn entity may not be able to join a queue because there is no capacity for them\n\nWe will look at the latter, but the way we approach it is the same for both - the only difference is that, in the former, the maximum queue length is likely to be an attribute of the patient (and may be individual per patient) just like in the reneging example, rather than an attribute of the model.\nHere, we’ll imagine that in our clinic, there is only space for 3 people to wait to see the nurse, and if there is no space, they cannot wait.\nTo model our balking requirements, we will : - Add a parameter to g class to store the maximum queue length allowed (if this were patient-decided balking, we’d put this in the patient class instead) - Add a list to our model attributes that will store all the patient objects currently in the queue for the nurse. This is really useful as it allows us to see who is in the queue at any time, as well as how many etc - Whenever a patient joins or leaves the queue, we’ll update the list of patients in the queue - Before we ask for the nurse resource, we’ll first check if the queue is at maximum size. If it is, the patient will never join the queue and we’ll record that. If not, we’ll proceed as before. We’ll add results of number of patients who balked to our results\n\n14.2.1 Coding a balking example\n\n14.2.1.1 The g Class\nWe’ll add a parameter value that will store the maximum length of the queue we allow for the nurse.\nLet’s imagine there’s only space for 3 people in the waiting room and so no more than 3 people can wait at any time.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nNote - we could simulate balking from the perspective of the patient instead (or as well) - e.g. the patient will only wait if there are no more than x people waiting etc. If we did this, we’d probably want to make this level an attribute of the patient, as it may vary between patients.\n\n\n\nclass g:\n    # Inter-arrival times\n    patient_inter = 5\n\n    # Activity times\n    mean_n_consult_time = 6\n    sd_n_consult_time = 1\n\n    # Resource numbers\n    number_of_nurses = 1\n\n    # Resource unavailability duration and frequency\n    unav_time_nurse = 15\n    unav_freq_nurse = 120\n\n    ##NEW\n    max_q_nurse = 3\n\n    # Simulation meta parameters\n    sim_duration = 2880\n    number_of_runs = 100\n    warm_up_period = 1440\n\n\n\n14.2.1.2 The Patient Class\nThis class is unchanged.\n\n\n14.2.1.3 The Model Class\n\n14.2.1.3.1 The init method\nHere we add in an additional attribute to count the number of people who balk.\nWe also we add a list that will store patient objects queuing for the nurse consultation.

    "text": "14.3 Jockeying\nTrue jockeying involves entities switching from one queue to another, typically because they make a decision that they will likely be seen faster if they do.\nIn over 13 years, the author has never used jockeying to model a healthcare system. SimPy documentation does not cover it either and makes a point of saying they won’t (which implies it’s complicated, though fundamentally you’d need a model of the behaviour in making that decision combined with removing the entity from one queue and placing it in another).\nThere are likely to be few systems that you will model that would use jockeying. However, you might encounter systems where entities pick which queue to join in the first place based on queue length (eg patients deciding which Minor Injury Unit or Emergency Department to attend based on live waiting time data online).\nFor that reason, the example here will be based on this kind of model.\n\n14.3.1 A ‘choosing queues’ example\nLet’s imagine a slight change to our nurse clinic model.\nLet’s imagine that, as well as the nurse, there is also a doctor that patients can see that offers the same service. Patients can choose to join whichever queue they prefer - and they do this by joining the nurse queue if it’s shorter (and the nurse has capacity), and otherwise joining the doctor’s queue.\nThe doctor’s queue has no limits on capacity, and the doctor does not take a break (or rather, there is always a doctor available).\nConsultation times with the doctor are slightly shorter on average (5 mins vs 6 mins for the nurse), but more variable (with a standard deviation of 3 mins vs 1 min for the nurse).\nWe’re also going to imagine that word has got out that there’s now a doctor available too, and demand has more than doubled - patients are now arriving at the clinic every 2 minutes on average, compared to an average of every 5 minutes before.\nDue to the new logic, there should never be any patients balking (as they’d join the doctor’s queue if the nurse queue is full, and the doctor’s queue doesn’t have a capacity constraint), but we’ll still record these numbers so we can check that.\n\n\n14.3.2 Coding the ‘choosing queues’ example\nThe full code can be seen below.\nThis example brings together code for -

We could choose to add\n        # something here if we wanted to record something - e.g. a counter\n        # for number of patients that left, recording something about the\n        # patients that left at a particular sink etc.\n\n\n\n17.1.1.3.4 A new method: audit_utilisation\nIn our model class, we can now create a new method.\nRemember that thanks to the additional attribute we added to the model class, we have now stored the time_with_nurse for each patient and can easily access it.\nAs we are only tracking a single resource in this model, we could write our function like this:\n\ndef audit_utilisation(self):\n    activity_durations = [i.time_with_nurse for i in self.patient_objects]\n\n    return (sum(activity_durations) / (g.number_of_nurses * g.sim_duration))\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\nA more generalisable form of this function is given below.\n\ndef audit_utilisation(self, activity_attribute, resource_attribute):\n    activity_durations = [i.getattr(activity_attribute) for i in self.patient_objects]\n\n    return (sum(activity_durations) / (g.getattr(resource_attribute) * g.sim_duration))\n\nThis will then be called like this.\n\nself.audit_utilisation(\"time_with_nurse\", \"number_of_nurses\")\n\nIf we were also recording time with a doctor, we might call that as\n\nself.audit_utilisation(\"time_with_doctor\", \"number_of_doctors\")\n\n\n\n\n\n17.1.1.3.5 The calculate_run_results method\nNow we are going to use this new method to add the utilisation metric to our results dataframe.\n\ndef calculate_run_results(self):\n    # Take the mean of the queuing times for the nurse across patients in\n    # this run of the model.\n    self.mean_q_time_nurse = self.results_df[\"Q Time Nurse\"].mean()\n\n    # This assumes we're not using the generalised version of the function\n    # which doesn't take any arguments\n    self.nurse_utilisation = self.audit_utilisation() ##NEW\n\nFinally, we can put this all together when we run the model.\n\n\n\n17.1.1.4 The trial class\n\n17.1.1.4.1 The init method\nFirst we add a\n\ndef  __init__(self):\n    self.df_trial_results = pd.DataFrame()\n    self.df_trial_results[\"Run Number\"] = [0]\n    self.df_trial_results[\"Mean Q Time Nurse\"] = [0.0]\n    self.df_trial_results[\"Average Nurse Utilisation\"] = [0.0] ##NEW\n    self.df_trial_results.set_index(\"Run Number\", inplace=True)\n\n\n\n17.1.1.4.2 The run_trial class\nFinally, we add this to the output dataframe.\nNote that we have had to tweak the step for adding results to our dataframe as there are now two possible columns for the result to go in - previously we could get away with just specifying the row in loc, but now we have to pass the column name too.\n\ndef run_trial(self):\n    # Run the simulation for the number of runs specified in g class.\n    # For each run, we create a new instance of the Model class and call its\n    # run method, which sets everything else in motion.  Once the run has\n    # completed, we grab out the stored run results (just mean queuing time\n    # here) and store it against the run number in the trial results\n    # dataframe.\n    for run in range(g.number_of_runs):\n        my_model = Model(run)\n        my_model.run()\n\n        self.df_trial_results.loc[run, \"Mean Q Time Nurse\"] = [my_model.mean_q_time_nurse] ##EDITED\n        self.df_trial_results.loc[run, \"Average Nurse Utilisation\"] = [my_model.nurse_utilisation] ##NEW\n\n    # Once the trial (ie all runs) has completed, print the final results\n    self.print_trial_results()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImportant\n\n\n\nThis method may slightly overestimate the utilisation.\nWhy?\nBecause we record the time spent with the resource prior to that time elapsing.\nIf we have a model run time of 600 time units, and someone reaches the nurse at unit 595 but has an activity time of 30, we will record that and use it in our calculations - even though only 5 minutes of that time actually took place during our model run.\nYou could adapt the code above to account for that - for example, you could check whether the time remaining in the model run (g.sim_duration - self.env.now) is greater than the activity time that is sampled, and record whichever is the smaller of the two as the patient attribute.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n17.1.2 The full code\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClick here to view the full code\n\n\n\n\n\n\nimport simpy\nimport random\nimport pandas as pd\n\n# Class to store global parameter values.

The number of this resource we have is\n    # specified by the capacity, and we grab this value from our g class.\n    self.nurse = simpy.Resource(self.env, capacity=g.number_of_nurses)\n\n    # Store the passed in run number\n    self.run_number = run_number\n\n    # Create a new Pandas DataFrame that will store some results against\n    # the patient ID (which we'll use as the index).\n    self.results_df = pd.DataFrame()\n    self.results_df[\"Patient ID\"] = [1]\n    self.results_df[\"Q Time Nurse\"] = [0.0]\n    self.results_df[\"Time with Nurse\"] = [0.0]\n    self.results_df.set_index(\"Patient ID\", inplace=True)\n\n    # Create an attribute to store the mean queuing time for the nurse\n    # across this run of the model\n    self.mean_q_time_nurse = 0\n\n    self.utilisation_audit = [] ##NEW\n\n\n\n17.2.1.2.2 A new method - interval_audit_utilisation\nThen we add the interval_audit_utilisation function to our Model class.\nWe set it up so either a list of resources can be passed as a dictionary, or just a single simpy resource object.\n\ndef interval_audit_utilisation(self, resources, interval=1):\n    '''\n    Record utilisation at defined intervals.\n\n    Needs to be passed to env.process when running model.\n\n    Parameters:\n    ------\n    resource: SimPy resource object\n        The resource to monitor\n        OR\n        a list of dictionaries containing simpy resource objects in the format\n        [{'resource_name':'my_resource', 'resource_object': resource},\n        {'resource_name':'my_second_resource', 'resource_object': resource_2}\n        ]\n        where resource and resource_2 in the examples above are simpy resources.\n\n    interval: int:\n        Time between audits.\n        In simpy time units\n        Default: 1\n    '''\n\n    # Keep doing the below as long as the simulation is running\n    while True:\n\n        # Code for what to do if we pass in a list of resources\n        if isinstance(resources, list):\n            for i in range(len(resources)):\n                self.utilisation_audit.append({\n                    'resource_name': resources[i]['resource_name'], # The provided name for the resource\n                    'simulation_time': self.env.now,  # The current simulation time\n                    'number_utilised': len(resources[i]['resource_object'].count), # The number of users\n                    'number_available': resources[i]['resource_object'].capacity, # The total resource available,\n                    'queue_length': len(resources[i]['resource_object'].queue)\n                })\n\n        else:\n\n            # Code for what to do if we just pass in a single resource to monitor\n            self.utilisation_audit.append({\n                'simulation_time': self.env.now,  # The current simulation time\n                'number_utilised': resources.count,  # The number of users\n                'number_available': resources.capacity, # The total resource available\n                'queue_length': len(resources.queue)\n            })\n\n\n        # Trigger next audit after desired interval has passed.\n        yield self.env.timeout(interval)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\nIf you are using a simpy PriorityResource instead of a standard resource, the code should work the same.\nIf you are using a simpy store instead of a simpy resource, it’s possibly to adapt by using len(resources.items) to get the number of resources currently being utilised, and resources.capacity will still return the total number of resources that are in the system.\n\n\n\n\n17.2.1.2.3 the run method\nWe now add the interval audit process to our run.\nRemember - this will update the self.utilisation_audit in our method class.\nHere we have passed in the nurse resource that gets created during the init method of the model class.\n\n    # The run method starts up the DES entity generators, runs the simulation,\n    # and in turns calls anything we need to generate results for the run\n        def run(self):\n        # Start up our DES entity generators that create new patients.

Evidence suggests that hospital processes, rather than clinical judgement, are responsible for this spike in admissions or discharge in the immediate period before a patient breaches the standard.”\n Source: NHS England analysis of Secondary Uses Services (SUS) data, via The PSC\nIf the target was removed, would this result in a change in behaviour? How might the predictions of our model be affected by this?",

Maybe each nurse and doctor in this example clinic has their own designated room they are always in.\nBut let’s imagine the setup is slightly different - patients see a receptionist and go to a waiting area - once both a cubicle and a nurse are available, the patient is seen by a nurse - if the patient then needs to see a doctor (which, as before, only a certain % of patients will) then they will remain in the same cubicle while waiting for a doctor - the doctor will see them in the cubicle\nThe cubicle is released for the next patient after seeing the nurse IF the patient leaves at this point.

We do not change anything in simpy itself to do this - but we just need to be careful that we remain consistent in our application of this throughout the rest of the model.\n\nshifts_df = pd.read_csv(\"resources/shifts_simplest.csv\")\n\n# Class to store global parameter values.

    "text": "23.3 Tracking additional metrics\nWe may find it useful to understand how many of our available appointment slots are going unused in the simulation.\nTo do this, we can slice our available_slots and bookings objects to just include the period of interest.\nRemember that available_slots refers to the number of remaining slots after bookings have been made - not the total available theoretical slots per day, which is stored in our g class as shifts - but remember that the shifts object is only a template for a seven day period rather than encompassing the whole model duration.\nTherefore, to get the total number of possible slots, we must do available_slots + bookings.\nThis will add up the relevant values on a day-by-day basis.\nWe can then sum available_slots to get the total number of slots that weren’t utilised, and then sum the result of available_slots + bookings to get the total number of slots that were available.

Therefore the utilisation is likely to be an underestimate.\nTo learn more about setting warm-up periods, refer to #sec-warmup",

    "text": "27.2 A code example\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nThanks go to Michael Allen for providing an example of how this can be achieved in SimPy. His repository can be found here.\n\n\nWe will make use of the Joblib package to easily split our SimPy code to run across multiple processor cores.\nWe will take the model created in the Reproducibility chapter (Chapter 13) and add parallelisation to it.\n\n27.2.1 Library imports\nWe will need to import Parallel and delayed from the joblib library.\nYou will need to run !pip install joblib if you have not previously made use of this library.\n\nfrom joblib import Parallel, delayed\n\n\n\n27.2.2 The g, Patient and Model classes\nOur g, patient and model classes are unchanged.\n\n\n27.2.3 The trial class\nIn the trial class, we need to change a number of functions, tweak our attributes, and make use of the joblib library.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWarning\n\n\n\nBecause of the way joblib executes things, if we try to keep track of our results in the same way we have so far - setting up a dummy dataframe and then using the .loc accessor to write our results to the correct row of the dataframe for each run - we will end up with an empty results list.\nInstead, we will create an empty list. Into this list we will place a dictionary of results from the run.\n\n\n\n27.2.3.1 The init method\nLet’s start by adjusting our __init__ method for our new way of carrying out the results collection.\n\ndef  __init__(self):\n    self.df_trial_results = []\n\n\n\n27.2.3.2 The process_trial_results method\nNext we want to create a new method that will turn our list of dictionaries into a Python dataframe.\nAll we need to do is call pd.DataFrame on that object. In this case, we overwrite the original df_trial_results object.\nNext we set the index of the dataframe to the run number, which is how it was set up in the original code.\n\ndef process_trial_results(self):\n  self.df_trial_results = pd.DataFrame(self.df_trial_results)\n  self.df_trial_results.set_index(\"Run Number\", inplace=True)\n\n\n\n27.2.3.3 the print_trial_results method\nBecause we went to the effort of setting the index in the step above, this method can remain unchanged.\n\n\n27.2.3.4 the run_single method\nFirst, let’s look back at how our run_trial function was written before.\n\ndef run_trial(self):\n        print(f\"{g.number_of_receptionists} receptionists, {g.number_of_nurses} nurses, {g.number_of_doctors} doctors\")\n        print(\"\") # Print a blank line\n\n        # Run the simulation for the number of runs specified in g class.\n        # For each run, we create a new instance of the Model class and call its\n        # run method, which sets everything else in motion.  Once the run has\n        # completed, we grab out the stored run results (just mean queuing time\n        # here) and store it against the run number in the trial results\n        # dataframe.\n\n        for run in range(g.number_of_runs):\n            random.seed(run)\n\n            my_model = Model(run)\n            patient_level_results = my_model.run()\n\n            self.df_trial_results.loc[run] = [\n                len(patient_level_results),\n                my_model.mean_q_time_recep,\n                my_model.mean_q_time_nurse,\n                my_model.mean_q_time_doctor\n                ]\n\n        # Once the trial (ie all runs) has completed, print the final results\n        self.print_trial_results()\n\nTo use parallelisation, we now split this out into two separate functions. The first is the run_single method.\nNote that it’s very similar to the indented part of the for loop from the code above.\nThe main change is how the results are stored - they are now put into a dictionary. Remember, dictionaries use the format {“key”:value} - here we have made our column names the ‘keys’ and our results the ‘values’.\nFinally, it’s important to return the results object from the function.\n\ndef run_single(self, run):\n    # For each run, we create a new instance of the Model class and call its\n    # run method, which sets everything else in motion.  Once the run has\n    # completed, we grab out the stored run results (just mean queuing time\n    # here) and store it against the run number in the trial results\n    # dataframe.\n    random.seed(run)\n\n    my_model = Model(run)\n    patient_level_results = my_model.run()\n\n    results = {\"Run Number\":run,\n        \"Arrivals\": len(patient_level_results),\n        \"Mean Q Time Recep\": my_model.mean_q_time_recep,\n        \"Mean Q Time Nurse\": my_model.mean_q_time_nurse,\n        \"Mean Q Time Doctor\": my_model.mean_q_time_doctor\n        }\n\n    return results\n\n\n\n27.2.3.5 the run_trial method\nFinally, we need to do a few things.\nThe key one is making our trial now use the Parallel class and delayed function.\nWe set up an instance of the Parallel class and set the number of jobs to -1.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\n-1 just means that the joblib library will use every available core to run the code.\nYou can instead specify a particular number of cores to use as a positive integer value.\n\n\nWe then pass in the self.run_single function to the delayed function.\nFinally, we pass in the arguments that are required for the self.run_single function, which is just the run number.\nThe syntax can appear a little bit strange - just take a close look at the full line below and try and understand it.\n\nself.df_trial_results = Parallel(n_jobs=-1)(delayed(self.run_single)(run) for run in range(g.number_of_runs))\n\nWe assign all of this to the self.df_trial_results attribute of our class.\nNow the only additional step is to run our new process_trial_results() function before we run print_trial_results().\n\ndef run_trial(self):\n    print(f\"{g.number_of_receptionists} receptionists, {g.number_of_nurses} nurses, {g.number_of_doctors} doctors\")\n    print(\"\") # Print a blank line\n\n    # Run the simulation for the number of runs specified in g class.\n    self.df_trial_results = Parallel(n_jobs=-1)(delayed(self.run_single)(run) for run in range(g.number_of_runs))\n\n    # Once the trial (ie all runs) has completed, print the final results\n    self.process_trial_results()\n    self.print_trial_results()\n\nVoila! Our model is now set up to use parallelisation. Let’s take a look at how much faster this can make things.",

As a noteworthy characteristic, simmer exploits the concept of trajectory: a common path in the simulation model for entities of the same type. It is pretty flexible and simple to use, and leverages the chaining/piping workflow introduced by the magrittr package.\n\n\nsimmer documentation\n\nThe documentation is notable for containing details on translating models from simpy to simmer.\nLink\nUsers of R in the NHS community have been exploring the use of simpy for healthcare examples for several years.\nThis tutorial from the strategy unit covers the creation of a simple model.\nOne key benefit is being able to plot a flow diagram of the steps in a simmer model.\n\n\n\nSimmer Plot: credit to Stacey Croft, Anastasiia Zharinova and Tom Jemmett 1",
