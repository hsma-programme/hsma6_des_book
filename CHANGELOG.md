* Consistent heading style ("Title Case For Titles", "Sentence case for all other headings") ([#3](https://github.com/hsma-programme/hsma6_des_book/issues/3)).
* Consistent sections and names where relevant (e.g. "Coding the model", "The full code - the full updated code for the model is given below" with the code then in a collapsible box) ([#3](https://github.com/hsma-programme/hsma6_des_book/issues/3)).
* Regarding the "##NEW" messages:
    * Add a callout about the "##NEW" convention used ([#8](https://github.com/hsma-programme/hsma6_des_book/issues/8)).
    * Ensured consistent use (removing "## NEW", "# NEW", "#MODIFIED", etc) ([#9](https://github.com/hsma-programme/hsma6_des_book/issues/9)).
* Consistent lists (with a ":", capitalisation and full stops).

* Add `plotly.express`, `pytest` and `sim_tools` to environment.
