**Work in Progress**

This book covers the use of the Simpy package for creating discrete event simulation models in the Python programming language. 

It accompanies the discrete event simulation module of the [Health Service Modelling Associates (HSMA) Programme](https://sites.google.com/nihr.ac.uk/hsma/introduction-to-hsma) and is intended to act as a reference manual for the three HSMA sessions on this topic, but also covers a range of additional concepts to enhance models. 

While the focus and examples are primarily healthcare-related, the concepts in this book can be applied to a wide range of models. 

The book can be viewed [here](https://hsma-programme.github.io/hsma6_des_book/).
