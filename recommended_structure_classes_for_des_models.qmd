There are many different ways to structure SimPy models.

You will often find different coders have their own preferred approach!

We’re going to structure our SimPy model in an Object Oriented way.

:::{.callout-info}
There are two main ways of programming in python - **functional** and **object oriented**. These are known as coding **paradigms**.

In functional programming, you write **functions** that are (ideally) designed to do one thing and do it well.
You then use these functions in some sort of sequence to achieve what you're trying to do.

This can make a lot of sense for

In object oriented programming (OOP), everything is centred around objects that have their own
- attributes (variables that belong to them) and
- methods (which are what functions are called when they belong to objects).

Objects are created as instances of classes.

Classes are essentially generalised blueprints for how certain types of objects should work!

This can be really useful in situations where you have either
- a lot of logic that makes sense to attach and organise with the thing that uses that logic (like a process)
- a need to make copies of a very similar thing (like lots of patients to populate a model)

Let’s look at an example.

Let’s say we want to write code that defines how an ambulance works.

There will be properties the ambulance has.  Things like :
- The organisation it belongs to
- The registration number
- Whether a patient is currently on board
- Whether the siren is currently going off

There will also be things the ambulance does :
- Driving
- Parking
- Having patients loaded into it / out of it
- Switching the siren on and off

In Object Oriented Programming, the things it has are known as attributes and the things it does are methods.

:::



Specifically, we’re going to have 4 different classes: g, entity, model, and trial.

:::{.callout-note}
Even among people using an object oriented approach, you will find some variations.

Again, there's nothing wrong with that!

Another common pattern you may come across in time is the Scenario, entity, model approach with single_run and multiple_run functions that don't exist inside a class.

Over time, you'll likely find a style used by someone else that you find particularly easy to follow and you want to adopt and adapt.

:::

While object oriented code can feel a bit cumbersome for small models, following the same sort of pattern each time makes it really easy to keep track of what your model is doing. It also makes it a lot easier to expand and modify your model over time.

The other benefit is that you will find other models from people who have done the HSMA course are likely to have a similar structure - so you should find it easier to read, reuse and tweak their models too!

**g Class**
This is a special class that will store our global level parameters for the model.

Unlike most OOP cases, we won’t create an instance of this class (hence the lower case) - we’ll just refer to the blueprint directly.

**Entity**
This class will represent our entity.

Often in our healthcare models, our entities will be patients.

Patients will carry with them information that we can record to and / or read from (e.g. an ID, how long they spent queuing, their condition etc).

If we had more than one entity, we’d need a class for each.

Multiple entities could be different types of patients - e.g. trauma patients and non-trauma patients.

**Model**
This is the big one that represents the system that we are modelling (our clinic in this case).

It’ll have our generators, our entity journeys and more, and it’s where our SimPy environment (where everything lives) will be kept.

**Trial**
This class will represent a batch of runs of our simulation, and will have methods to run a trial, extract results etc.


## g Class

The g Class stores our global parameter values for the model so we can easily change aspects of the model to test scenarios.  This includes :

- Values to define inter-arrival time distributions (eg mean, standard deviation etc)
- Values to define activity time distributions (eg mean, standard deviation etc)
- Number of each resource
- Duration of simulation runs
- Number of runs in a trial

We do not create an instance of g class.  Instead, we refer to it directly when we need to access something in it.

:::{.callout-info}
### Example g class
```{python}
class g:
    patient_inter = 5
    mean_n_consult_time = 6
    number_of_nurses = 1
    sim_duration = 120
    number_of_runs = 5
```
:::

## Entity class

The entity class represents our entity in the model - which, for healthcare models, will often be patients.

We can store attributes here that entities carry with them that we may want to access (think of a person carrying a clipboard with them with information on it).

In a simple model, an entity may just carry their ID and how long they spent queuing for a resource (once known).  But more advanced models could store things like their condition, their priority, probability of going down path x, etc.

:::{.callout-info}
### Example entity class
```{python}
class Patient:
    def __init__(self, p_id):
        self.id = p_id
        self.q_time_nurse = 0
```
:::

## Model Class

The Model Class represents the system we are modelling - this might be a clinic, for example.  As such, there’s a lot more to unpack here, so let’s take this bit by bit.

First, we’ll look at the constructor for our model.

The constructor will set up
- a SimPy Environment (basically where everything lives)
- an entity counter (which we’ll use to give entities - such as patients - a simple ID)
- the resources we need (for example, our nurses)
- a DataFrame to store per-entity results in a single run of the model
- attributes to store things like how long the entities queued for each activity

What the constructor sets up doesn't have to be limited to these things - anything relating to the system as a whole that makes sense to store here could be included.

### DES generator - arrivals of entities to the system

Within the Model Class we have a **generator function** that will represent our DES generator for patients **arriving into the clinic**.

Here’s basically how it works:

*KEEP REPEATING THE FOLLOWING FOREVER (until the simulation stops running) :*
1. Increment the patient counter to get ID for next patient
2. Create a new patient and give them that ID
3. Start up an instance of the generator function for their journey through the clinic and chuck them in it
4. Sample the time until the next patient arrives
5. FREEZE this function until that time elapses
6. Return to 1

### DES Generator - the entity journey

Now, let’s look at the big one.  The other generator function - the one that represents a patient’s journey through the system (this is the one we lobbed the new patients generated by the previous generator).

Here’s how this works :
1. Record time started queuing for first activity
2. Request resource for first activity
3. Wait until resource is free
4. Once resource is free, grab the resource and keep hold of the resource until finished with them.  Record time finished queuing and calculate queue time.
5. Sample how long will spend in this activity.
6. FREEZE this instance of the function until that time elapses (freezing the resource with it, so it’s not available to anyone else)
7. If there’s another activity, do the same again for that one.  If not, end (and therefore entity leaves the model).

### Running the model

Finally, we need a run method in our Model class.  Basically, the run method will :
- Start up our DES generators (our arrival points) - we only have one here.
- Tell the simulation to run for the duration specified in g Class.
- Call the calculate run results method in the previous slide.
- Print out the run number with the patient-level results from this run.

### Full Example model class
```{python}
class Model:
    # Constructor to set up the model for a run.  We pass in a run number when
    # we create a new model.
    def __init__(self, run_number):
        # Create a SimPy environment in which everything will live
        self.env = simpy.Environment()

        # Create a patient counter (which we'll use as a patient ID)
        self.patient_counter = 0

        # Create a SimPy resource to represent a nurse, that will live in the
        # environment created above.  The number of this resource we have is
        # specified by the capacity, and we grab this value from our g class.
        self.nurse = simpy.Resource(self.env, capacity=g.number_of_nurses)

        # Store the passed in run number
        self.run_number = run_number

        # Create a new Pandas DataFrame that will store some results against
        # the patient ID (which we'll use as the index).
        self.results_df = pd.DataFrame()
        self.results_df["Patient ID"] = [1]
        self.results_df["Q Time Nurse"] = [0.0]
        self.results_df["Time with Nurse"] = [0.0]
        self.results_df.set_index("Patient ID", inplace=True)

        # Create an attribute to store the mean queuing time for the nurse
        # across this run of the model
        self.mean_q_time_nurse = 0

    # A generator function that represents the DES generator for patient
    # arrivals
    def generator_patient_arrivals(self):
        # We use an infinite loop here to keep doing this indefinitely whilst
        # the simulation runs
        while True:
            # Increment the patient counter by 1 (this means our first patient
            # will have an ID of 1)
            self.patient_counter += 1

            # Create a new patient - an instance of the Patient Class we
            # defined above.  Remember, we pass in the ID when creating a
            # patient - so here we pass the patient counter to use as the ID.
            p = Patient(self.patient_counter)

            # Tell SimPy to start up the attend_clinic generator function with
            # this patient (the generator function that will model the
            # patient's journey through the system)
            self.env.process(self.attend_clinic(p))

            # Randomly sample the time to the next patient arriving.  Here, we
            # sample from an exponential distribution (common for inter-arrival
            # times), and pass in a lambda value of 1 / mean.  The mean
            # inter-arrival time is stored in the g class.
            sampled_inter = random.expovariate(1.0 / g.patient_inter)

            # Freeze this instance of this function in place until the
            # inter-arrival time we sampled above has elapsed.  Note - time in
            # SimPy progresses in "Time Units", which can represent anything
            # you like (just make sure you're consistent within the model)
            yield self.env.timeout(sampled_inter)

    # A generator function that represents the pathway for a patient going
    # through the clinic.  Here the pathway is extremely simple - a patient
    # arrives, waits to see a nurse, and then leaves.
    # The patient object is passed in to the generator function so we can
    # extract information from / record information to it
    def attend_clinic(self, patient):
        # Record the time the patient started queuing for a nurse
        start_q_nurse = self.env.now

        # This code says request a nurse resource, and do all of the following
        # block of code with that nurse resource held in place (and therefore
        # not usable by another patient)
        with self.nurse.request() as req:
            # Freeze the function until the request for a nurse can be met.
            # The patient is currently queuing.
            yield req

            # When we get to this bit of code, control has been passed back to
            # the generator function, and therefore the request for a nurse has
            # been met.  We now have the nurse, and have stopped queuing, so we
            # can record the current time as the time we finished queuing.
            end_q_nurse = self.env.now

            # Calculate the time this patient was queuing for the nurse, and
            # record it in the patient's attribute for this.
            patient.q_time_nurse = end_q_nurse - start_q_nurse

            # Now we'll randomly sample the time this patient with the nurse.
            # Here, we use an Exponential distribution for simplicity, but you
            # would typically use a Log Normal distribution for a real model
            # (we'll come back to that).  As with sampling the inter-arrival
            # times, we grab the mean from the g class, and pass in 1 / mean
            # as the lambda value.
            sampled_nurse_act_time = random.expovariate(1.0 /
                                                        g.mean_n_consult_time)

            # Here we'll store the queuing time for the nurse and the sampled
            # time to spend with the nurse in the results DataFrame against the
            # ID for this patient.  In real world models, you may not want to
            # bother storing the sampled activity times - but as this is a
            # simple model, we'll do it here.
            # We use a handy property of pandas called .at, which works a bit
            # like .loc.  .at allows us to access (and therefore change) a
            # particular cell in our DataFrame by providing the row and column.
            # Here, we specify the row as the patient ID (the index), and the
            # column for the value we want to update for that patient.
            self.results_df.at[patient.id, "Q Time Nurse"] = (
                patient.q_time_nurse)
            self.results_df.at[patient.id, "Time with Nurse"] = (
                sampled_nurse_act_time)

            # Freeze this function in place for the activity time we sampled
            # above.  This is the patient spending time with the nurse.
            yield self.env.timeout(sampled_nurse_act_time)

            # When the time above elapses, the generator function will return
            # here.  As there's nothing more that we've written, the function
            # will simply end.  This is a sink.  We could choose to add
            # something here if we wanted to record something - e.g. a counter
            # for number of patients that left, recording something about the
            # patients that left at a particular sink etc.

    # This method calculates results over a single run.  Here we just calculate
    # a mean, but in real world models you'd probably want to calculate more.
    def calculate_run_results(self):
        # Take the mean of the queuing times for the nurse across patients in
        # this run of the model.
        self.mean_q_time_nurse = self.results_df["Q Time Nurse"].mean()

    # The run method starts up the DES entity generators, runs the simulation,
    # and in turns calls anything we need to generate results for the run
    def run(self):
        # Start up our DES entity generators that create new patients.  We've
        # only got one in this model, but we'd need to do this for each one if
        # we had multiple generators.
        self.env.process(self.generator_patient_arrivals())

        # Run the model for the duration specified in g class
        self.env.run(until=g.sim_duration)

        # Now the simulation run has finished, call the method that calculates

## Trial class

Our final class is the Trial class.  This represents a batch of simulation runs, and will contain methods to run a batch of runs, as well as store, record and display results from the trial.

:::{.callout-info}
### Example trial class
```{python}
class Trial:
    # The constructor sets up a pandas dataframe that will store the key
    # results from each run (just the mean queuing time for the nurse here)
    # against run number, with run number as the index.
    def  __init__(self):
        self.df_trial_results = pd.DataFrame()
        self.df_trial_results["Run Number"] = [0]
        self.df_trial_results["Mean Q Time Nurse"] = [0.0]
        self.df_trial_results.set_index("Run Number", inplace=True)

    # Method to print out the results from the trial.  In real world models,
    # you'd likely save them as well as (or instead of) printing them
    def print_trial_results(self):
        print ("Trial Results")
        print (self.df_trial_results)

    # Method to run a trial
    def run_trial(self):
        # Run the simulation for the number of runs specified in g class.
        # For each run, we create a new instance of the Model class and call its
        # run method, which sets everything else in motion.  Once the run has
        # completed, we grab out the stored run results (just mean queuing time
        # here) and store it against the run number in the trial results
        # dataframe.
        for run in range(g.number_of_runs):
            my_model = Model(run)
            my_model.run()

            self.df_trial_results.loc[run] = [my_model.mean_q_time_nurse]

        # Once the trial (ie all runs) has completed, print the final results
        self.print_trial_results()
```
:::

We can, of course, then take the means over the runs in the trial to get the average predicted queuing time etc. - and we should probably do that in a separate method in the Trial class.
