    "text": "Attribution and Acknowledgements\nThe content in this book is a combined effort, bringing together the knowledge of the Peninsula Collaborative for Operational Research and Design (PenCHORD) on the topic.\nThe content in part 1 and a large amount of part 2 is from a series of sessions given on discrete event simulation as part of the HSMA programme. These lectures and accompanying code examples were written by Dr Daniel Chalk and made available under the CC BY-NC-SA 4.0 licence. The chapters often replicate the wording of these lectures nearly exactly, with minor tweaks and additions for readability and to better suit the format of a book made by Sammi Rosser.\nThe content in parts 3 and 4 is more of a mixture of content from the HSMA lectures along with brand new content written for this book, drawing on a range of work done by the wider PenCHORD team.\nAll work that has been adapted is licenced under the MIT Licence.
