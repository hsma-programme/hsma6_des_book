Then you can run it 1000 times with slightly different random days to see how well it performs on both good days and bad.\nYou can polish it all off by visualising the individual entities moving through the system so people with little understanding of discrete event simulation can get a sense of what’s going on, and you can give them access to all of the controls - the number of nurses and doctors, the average consultation length, and more - so that they can explore the impact of theser changes themselves.",

Or unusually long inter-arrival times (a run of “good luck”)?\nWe need to run a stochastic simulation many times and take summary statistics over the results from each run to get more representative results from the model.\nA single run of a model for a simulated period of time is known as a run.

    "section": "2.4 Key DES Terminology",
    "text": "2.4 Key DES Terminology\n\nEntities are the things that are flowing through the sequential processes in the model (eg patients, test results, callers on a phone)\nGenerators are the way in which entities enter the model and come into being (eg arriving at ED by ambulance, self-presenting, referral from GP)\nInter-Arrival Times specify the time between entities being generated in the generators (ie the time between arrivals into the modelled system)\nActivities (sometimes referred to as Servers) are the bits of process that the entities are queuing up for (eg triaged, seen at reception, speak to doctor etc)\nActivity Time represents the amount of time it takes for an activity to happen to an entity - this is normally stochastic (random) and drawn from a distribution for each entity (eg time spent with nurse, time to be treated etc)\nResources are the “stuff” and / or “staff” required for an activity to happen to an entity (eg nurse to triage, bed for patient, consultation room for GP to see patient etc, X-Ray machine and Radiographer to be free for X-Ray etc). Important - resources may be shared between activities (eg the same nurse may be required to run multiple activities in our model, or even things we haven’t explicitly modelled)\nQueues hold entities that are waiting for an activity. Entities wait in a queue until the activity has both the capacity and all required resources.\nSinks are how entities leave the model (the bit of system we’re modelling)\n\n\n2.4.1 Entities\nEach entity may have certain “attributes” that it “carries with them” to help determine its journey through the modelled system. For example :\n\nwhether it goes down path A or B\nhow long it spends in an activity\nits priority in a queue for an activity\n\nThere may also be more than one type of entity in a model at the same time. For example, patients in a clinic, their test results, and phone calls into the clinic are all entities that we may want to capture when modelling the clinic.\n\n\n\n2.4.2 Generators and Inter-Arrival\nA generator creates new entities to bring into the system. The rate at which new entities are generated is determined by an inter-arrival time.\nThe inter-arrival time determines the time between one entity being generated, and the next one being generated.\nInter-arrival times may be fixed, but are typically sampled (drawn) stochastically (randomly) from a distribution to capture variability (even if the variability is small).\nAn Exponential Distribution is often used to sample inter-arrival times. More than one distribution may be used for the same generator (e.g. for different times of the day, day of week etc). You may also (often) have more than one generator in a system.\n\n\n\n2.4.3 Queues\nEach activity in a Discrete Event Simulation has an associated queue. The queue holds entities whilst they wait for the activity to become available for them.\nEach queue has a queuing policy. This determines the order in which entities are released from the queue into the activity. The two most common queuing policies are:\n\nFirst In First Out (FIFO) : entities are seen in the order they arrive. This is the default.\nPriority-based : entities are seen according to some priority attribute. Ties often resolved using FIFO\n\n\n\n\n2.4.4 Activities and Activity Times\nEach activity in a DES describes a process – this may be a simple atomic task, or a set of tasks bundled together. For an activity to take place, it needs : - An entity (drawn from the queue) - The required type and number of resource to be available\nOnce the above conditions have been met, the activity begins. The entity, and the resource(s) are then locked in place for an amount of time – the Activity Time. The resource(s) cannot be used elsewhere until the activity time has passed.\nActivity times may be fixed, but are typically sampled stochastically from a distribution.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\nThe common distribution for process times is the Log Normal distributions. However, Exponential Distributions can be a good starting point, as it’s easy to change the “mean” when playing around with things. You can then change to something like a Log Normal once you (and the stakeholders) are happy\n\n\n\n\n2.4.5 Resources\nResources are needed to undertake activities. An activity may require just a single resource, more than one resource of the same type, or multiple resources of different types.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\nAn activity may not require a resource at all, but think carefully to ensure that it really is either “resourceless” or there is no constraint on the resource (and so doesn’t need to be modelled).\nResources can include - “staff” (e.g. doctors, nurses, officers etc) - “stuff” (beds, test equipment, detention cell etc)\n\n\nResources can (and often are) shared across a system, so may be required for more than one activity. Therefore, a resource drain in one part of the system can affect another.\nAll required resources are needed for an activity to take place.\nIn some activities, having optional additional resource may speed up the activity (though rarely linearly).\n\n\n\n2.4.6 Sinks\nSinks are how entities leave the system, or part of the system, being modelled. Sinks might include : - an entity physically leaving a system (e.g. discharge from hospital) - an entity no longer existing (e.g. death, use of sample, end of telephone call) - an entity no longer needing to access activities that we’re interested in (e.g. they leave the bit of the system that we’re modelling)\nThe most important thing to remember about a sink is that it doesn’t necessarily represent an entity leaving the system entirely.\nFor example, the scope of your model may only cover the triage aspect of an Emergency Department. Therefore, a valid sink might be placed after their triage - they’ve left the scope of our model\n\n\n\n2.4.7 Branching Paths\nReal world systems (and the models of those systems) are rarely linear. Often, different things will happen to different entities. In a Discrete Event Simulation, this means different entities flowing to different activities, or different sinks.\nWe might differentiate based on : - an attribute of the patient (e.g. patients with a higher priority value flow through a different set of activities) - probability (e.g. we know that approx 60% of these patients end up being admitted, so we’ll randomly select for them to be admitted 60% of the time) - time (e.g. after a certain time of day, entities flow through a different set of activities)\n\n\n\n2.4.8 Outputs\nAs with any type of model, it’s important to think about what outputs you need your DES model to generate to answer your modelling questions. As a DES model is used to model queuing and resourcing problems, typical DES model outputs include average, min, max, xth percentile of :\n\ntime entities are in system\nqueue length and duration for queues of interest\nrate of resource utilisation (ie % of time a resource is in use for activities in the model)\nprobability of exceeding a defined queue length / queue time / resource utilisation threshold (e.g. 4 hour wait in ED, overcrowding thresholds)",

In models of pathways where people arrive for a service, this will likely be minutes (seconds is too much, and hours is probably not enough, unless all the processes are slow).

    "text": "3.2 Generator Functions\nSimPy is built around a special type of function in Python known as a Generator Function.\nSo let’s have a look at what we mean by a Generator Function.\nConventional functions in Python are called, then run with some (optional) inputs, and then finish (usually by returning some output). When we call the function again, it runs again, from scratch.\nGenerator functions remember where they were and what they did when control is passed back (they retain their local state), so that they can continue where they left off, and can be used as powerful iterators (for and while loops are other examples of iterators).\nThis is very useful where we want state to be maintained, so we can remember how long until we generate the next entity, or where an entity is in a pathway…\nLet’s look at a very simple example of a generator function to see how they work.\n\nIn SimPy, we use Generator Functions in two different places :\nTo model the DES generators (arrival points) To model the individual journey of each entity\nLet’s imagine we are modelling patients in a patient pathway.\nFor 1, the generator function basically creates a patient, sets them off on their pathway, then freezes in place for an amount of time representing the inter-arrival time to the next patient. Then it does it all over again.\nFor 2, the generator function requests a resource and freezes until that resource is available (the queue). When the resource is available it freezes in place for an amount of time with it (the activity). It will then either move on to the next activity (and request the resource for it, as above) or end if there are no further activities.",

    "text": "4.3 Model Class\nThe Model Class represents the system we are modelling - this might be a clinic, for example. As such, there’s a lot more to unpack here, so let’s take this bit by bit.\nFirst, we’ll look at the constructor for our model.\nThe constructor will set up - a SimPy Environment (basically where everything lives) - an entity counter (which we’ll use to give entities - such as patients - a simple ID) - the resources we need (for example, our nurses) - a DataFrame to store per-entity results in a single run of the model - attributes to store things like how long the entities queued for each activity\nWhat the constructor sets up doesn’t have to be limited to these things - anything relating to the system as a whole that makes sense to store here could be included.\n\n4.3.1 DES generator - arrivals of entities to the system\nWithin the Model Class we have a generator function that will represent our DES generator for entities arriving into our process.\nHere’s basically how it works:\nKEEP REPEATING THE FOLLOWING FOREVER (until the simulation stops running) : 1. Increment the counter to get ID for next entity 2. Create a new entity and give them that ID 3. Start up an instance of the generator function for their journey through the process and chuck them in it 4. Sample the time until the next entity arrives 5. FREEZE this function until that time elapses 6. Return to 1\n\n\n4.3.2 DES Generator - the entity journey\nNow, let’s look at the big one. The other generator function - the one that represents an entity’s journey through the system (this is the one we lobbed the new entities generated by the previous generator).\nHere’s how this works : 1. Record time started queuing for first activity 2. Request resource for first activity 3. Wait until resource is free 4. Once resource is free, grab the resource and keep hold of the resource until finished with them. Record time finished queuing and calculate queue time. 5. Sample how long will spend in this activity. 6. FREEZE this instance of the function until that time elapses (freezing the resource with it, so it’s not available to anyone else) 7. If there’s another activity, do the same again for that one. If not, end (and therefore entity leaves the model).\n\n\n4.3.3 Running the model\nFinally, we need a run method in our Model class. Basically, the run method will : - Start up our DES generators (our arrival points) - we only have one here. - Tell the simulation to run for the duration specified in g Class. - Call the calculate run results method in the previous slide. - Print out the run number with the patient-level results from this run.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFull Example model class\n\n\n\n\nclass Model:\n    # Constructor to set up the model for a run.

    "text": "Very often there will be more than one activity in a model.\nWhat if instead of this model\n\nWe wanted something more like this?\n\nIf we want patients to flow from one activity to another, we just write another one after the first one in the pathway generator function. That (aside from adding in any extra resources and results capture elsewhere) is it.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWarning\n\n\n\nJust make sure you write the next bit outside of the with statement. Otherwise you’ll drag across the resource from the previous activity too…\nOf course, in some cases, you might want that - perhaps if you’re modelling a bed as a resource, for example, but then want to model using an additional resource like a nurse for some parts of the process.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\nThroughout the code, anything new that’s been added will be followed by the comment ##NEW - so look out for that in the following code chunks.\n\n\nFirst, lets add some additional parameters to our g class.\n\nclass g:\n    patient_inter = 5\n    mean_reception_time = 2 ##NEW\n    mean_n_consult_time = 6\n    number_of_receptionists = 1 ##NEW\n    number_of_nurses = 1\n    sim_duration = 120\n    number_of_runs = 5\n\nNext we’ll add an additional attribute - think of it as an extra box on their clipboard that they need to fill in - to record how long they are queuing for the receptionist.\n\nclass Patient:\n    def __init__(self, p_id):\n        self.id = p_id\n        self.q_time_recep = 0 ##NEW\n        self.q_time_nurse = 0\n\nNow we move to our model class. Let’s start by looking at the init method - the list of things that are set up when we create an instance of our model class.\nFirst, we have added in a new type of resource - a receptionist, pulling in the number of receptionist to create from our g class.\nWe’ve then added two additional fields to our results dataframe - how long each patient queues for a receptionist, and how long each patient spends with the receptionist.\nFinally, we add in an attribute that we will use to store the mean average queuing time for receptionists across the whole model.\n\ndef __init__(self, run_number):\n        # Create a SimPy environment in which everything will live\n        self.env = simpy.Environment()\n\n        # Create a patient counter (which we'll use as a patient ID)\n        self.patient_counter = 0\n\n        # Create our resources\n        self.receptionist = simpy.Resource(\n            self.env, capacity=g.number_of_receptionists\n        ) ##NEW\n        self.nurse = simpy.Resource(self.env, capacity=g.number_of_nurses)\n\n        # Store the passed in run number\n        self.run_number = run_number\n\n        # Create a new Pandas DataFrame that will store some results against\n        # the patient ID (which we'll use as the index).\n        self.results_df = pd.DataFrame()\n        self.results_df[\"Patient ID\"] = [1]\n        self.results_df[\"Q Time Recep\"] = [0.0] ##NEW\n        self.results_df[\"Time with Recep\"] = [0.0] ##NEW\n        self.results_df[\"Q Time Nurse\"] = [0.0]\n        self.results_df[\"Time with Nurse\"] = [0.0]\n        self.results_df.set_index(\"Patient ID\", inplace=True)\n\n        # Create an attribute to store the mean queuing times across this run of\n        # the model\n        self.mean_q_time_recep = 0 ##NEW\n        self.mean_q_time_nurse = 0\n\nOur generator_patient_arrivals method remains unchanged as nothing has been tweaked about how patients turn up to the system.\nOur attend_clinic method is where we make the actual change to the process the patient goes through.\nNote that we have a new line with an indended section inside it.\n\nwith self.receptionist.request() as req:\n\nEverything at one level of indentation within this now relates to the use of the receptionist resource.\n\n # A generator function that represents the pathway for a patient going\n    # through the clinic.\n    # The patient object is passed in to the generator function so we can\n    # extract information from / record information to it\n    def attend_clinic(self, patient):\n        ##NEW - added reception activity\n        start_q_recep = self.env.now\n\n        with self.receptionist.request() as req:\n            yield req\n\n            end_q_recep = self.env.now\n\n            patient.q_time_recep = end_q_recep - start_q_recep\n\n            sampled_recep_act_time = random.expovariate(\n                1.0 / g.mean_reception_time\n            )\n\n            self.results_df.at[patient.id, \"Q Time Recep\"] = (\n                 patient.q_time_recep\n            )\n            self.results_df.at[patient.id, \"Time with Recep\"] = (\n                 sampled_recep_act_time\n            )\n\n            yield self.env.timeout(sampled_recep_act_time)\n\n        # Here's where the patient finishes with the receptionist, and starts\n        # queuing for the nurse\n\n        # Record the time the patient started queuing for a nurse\n        start_q_nurse = self.env.now\n\n        # This code says request a nurse resource, and do all of the following\n        # block of code with that nurse resource held in place (and therefore\n        # not usable by another patient)\n        with self.nurse.request() as req:\n            # Freeze the function until the request for a nurse can be met.\n            # The patient is currently queuing.\n            yield req\n\n            # When we get to this bit of code, control has been passed back to\n            # the generator function, and therefore the request for a nurse has\n            # been met.

Let’s pull that out:\n\nprint(g.prob_seeing_doctor)\n\n0.6\n\n\nThe code in the Model class tests whether the number generated by the random number generator is below the threshold we’ve set of seeing the doctor. If it is, the indented code where we actually see the doctor will be run for that patient. If it is not, that bit is bypassed - which in this case means they’ve reached the end of their journey and leave the system (a sink).\n\nfor i in range(10):\n  random_number = random.uniform(0,1)\n  is_below_threshold = random_number &lt; g.prob_seeing_doctor\n\n  if is_below_threshold:\n    print(f\"Random number {random_number:.2f} is LOWER than threshold ({g.prob_seeing_doctor}). \" +\n    \"Doctor code is triggered.\")\n  else:\n    print(f\"Random number {random_number:.2f} is HIGHER than threshold ({g.prob_seeing_doctor}). \" +\n    \"Doctor code is **not** triggered.\")\n\nRandom number 0.51 is LOWER than threshold (0.6). Doctor code is triggered.\nRandom number 0.03 is LOWER than threshold (0.6). Doctor code is triggered.\nRandom number 0.20 is LOWER than threshold (0.6). Doctor code is triggered.\nRandom number 0.65 is HIGHER than threshold (0.6). Doctor code is **not** triggered.\nRandom number 0.54 is LOWER than threshold (0.6). Doctor code is triggered.\nRandom number 0.22 is LOWER than threshold (0.6). Doctor code is triggered.\nRandom number 0.59 is LOWER than threshold (0.6). Doctor code is triggered.\nRandom number 0.81 is HIGHER than threshold (0.6). Doctor code is **not** triggered.\nRandom number 0.01 is LOWER than threshold (0.6). Doctor code is triggered.\nRandom number 0.81 is HIGHER than threshold (0.6). Doctor code is **not** triggered.\n\n\nIf we run this code a hundred thousand times and plot the results, we can start to see the pattern emerging despite the random element of the number generator.\n\nimport plotly.express as px\nimport pandas as pd\nimport numpy as np\n\nrandom_vals = [random.uniform(0,1) for i in range(100000)]\n\nrandom_vals_df = pd.DataFrame({\"value\" :random_vals})\n\nrandom_vals_df['threshold'] = np.where(random_vals_df[\"value\"]&lt;0.6, 'below', 'above')\n\nfig = px.histogram(random_vals_df, color=\"threshold\")\n\nfig.update_traces(xbins=dict(\n        start=0.0,\n        end=1.0,\n        size=0.1\n    ),\n    marker_line_width=1,marker_line_color=\"black\")\n\n\nfig.show()\n\n                                                \n\n\nSo for every 1000 patients, roughly 600 will see a doctor, and roughly 400 will leave the system straight after seeing the nurse.\n\n\n8.1.3.4 The calculate_run_results method\nIn this method, we just add an additional step to measure the mean time spent queueing for a doctor across all patients in this run.\n\n# This method calculates results over a single run.  Here we just calculate\n# a mean, but in real world models you'd probably want to calculate more.\ndef calculate_run_results(self):\n    # Take the mean of the queuing times across patients in this run of the\n    # model.\n    self.mean_q_time_recep = self.results_df[\"Q Time Recep\"].mean()\n    self.mean_q_time_nurse = self.results_df[\"Q Time Nurse\"].mean()\n    self.mean_q_time_doctor = self.results_df[\"Q Time Doctor\"].mean() ##NEW\n\n\n\n8.1.3.5 The run method\nThe run method is unchanged\n\n\n\n8.1.4 The trial class\n\n8.1.4.1 The init method\nIn the init method, we just add a placeholder for measuring the mean queue time of a doctor.\n\ndef  __init__(self):\n    self.df_trial_results = pd.DataFrame()\n    self.df_trial_results[\"Run Number\"] = [0]\n    self.df_trial_results[\"Mean Q Time Recep\"] = [0.0]\n    self.df_trial_results[\"Mean Q Time Nurse\"] = [0.0]\n    self.df_trial_results[\"Mean Q Time Doctor\"] = [0.0] ##NEW\n    self.df_trial_results.set_index(\"Run Number\", inplace=True)\n\n\n\n8.1.4.2 The run_trial method\nHere, we just add in the mean queue time for the doctor to the trial results dataframe.\n\n  def run_trial(self):\n      # Run the simulation for the number of runs specified in g class.\n      # For each run, we create a new instance of the Model class and call its\n      # run method, which sets everything else in motion.

If it is, we do it. If it’s not, we don’t.\nLet’s look at an example. This is a slightly amended version of the model of patients coming in for a nurse consultation with a few tweaks (longer duration, more runs, added trial results calculation)\nWe’re going to assume this is a system that’s open 24 hours - let’s imagine this is a triage function at an emergency department.\nI’ve marked the bits I’ve added to include warm up with ##NEW\n\n10.2.1 The g class\nFirst we add in a new parameter - the length of the warm-up period.\nHere, the sim duration has been set to 2880, and the warm-up-period to half of this (1440). You don’t need to stick to this pattern - your warm-up could even be longer than your results collection if you want!\n\n# Class to store global parameter values.\nclass g:\n    # Inter-arrival times\n    patient_inter = 5\n\n    # Activity times\n    mean_n_consult_time = 6\n\n    # Resource numbers\n    number_of_nurses = 1\n\n    # Simulation meta parameters\n    sim_duration = 2880\n    warm_up_period = 1440 ##NEW - this will be in addition to the sim_duration\n    number_of_runs = 100\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\nIf you find it easier to keep track of, you could define your warm-up like this instead.\n\nresults_collection_period = 2880\nwarm_up_period = 1440\ntotal_sim_duration = results_collection_period + warm_up_period\n\n\n\n\n\n10.2.2 The patient class\nOur patient class is unchanged.\n\n\n10.2.3 The model class\nIn the model class, the ‘attend_clinic’ method changes.\nWe look at the current elapsed simulation time with the attribute self.env.now\nThen, whenever a patient attends the clinic and is using a nurse resource, we check whether the current simulation time is later than the number of time units we’ve set as our warm-up.\n\n10.2.3.1 The attend_clinic method\n\n# Generator function representing pathway for patients attending the\n# clinic.\ndef attend_clinic(self, patient):\n    # Nurse consultation activity\n    start_q_nurse = self.env.now\n\n    with self.nurse.request() as req:\n        yield req\n\n        end_q_nurse = self.env.now\n\n        patient.q_time_nurse = end_q_nurse - start_q_nurse\n\n        ##NEW - this checks whether the warm up period has passed before\n        # adding any results\n        if self.env.now &gt; g.warm_up_period:\n            self.results_df.at[patient.id, \"Q Time Nurse\"] = (\n                patient.q_time_nurse\n            )\n\n        sampled_nurse_act_time = random.expovariate(1.0 /\n                                                    g.mean_n_consult_time)\n\n        yield self.env.timeout(sampled_nurse_act_time)\n\nFor example, if the simulation time is at 840 and our warm_up is 1440, this bit of code - which adds the queuing time for this patient to our records - won’t run:\n\nself.results_df.at[patient.id, \"Q Time Nurse\"] = (\n    patient.q_time_nurse\n)\n\nHowever, if the simulation time is 1680, for example, it will.\n\n\n\n10.2.4 the calculate_run_results method\nAs we now won’t count the first patient, we need to remove the dummy first patient result entry we created when we set up the dataframe.\n\n# Method to calculate and store results over the run\ndef calculate_run_results(self):\n    self.results_df.drop([1], inplace=True) ##NEW\n\n    self.mean_q_time_nurse = self.results_df[\"Q Time Nurse\"].mean()\n\n\n10.2.4.1 The run method\nNext we need to tweak the duration of our model to reflect the combination of the period we want to collect results for and the warm-up period.\n\n# Method to run a single run of the simulation\ndef run(self):\n    # Start up DES generators\n    self.env.process(self.generator_patient_arrivals())\n\n    # Run for the duration specified in g class\n    ##NEW - we need to tell the simulation to run for the specified duration\n    # + the warm up period if we still want the specified duration in full\n    self.env.run(until=(g.sim_duration + g.warm_up_period))\n\n    # Calculate results over the run\n    self.calculate_run_results()\n\n    # Print patient level results for this run\n    print (f\"Run Number {self.run_number}\")\n    print (self.results_df)\n\n\n\n\n10.2.5 The Trial class\nOur trial class is unchanged.",

This ensure it takes priority over any patients\n        # (whose priority values start at 1).  But it also means that the\n        # nurse won't go on a break until they've finished with the current\n        # patient\n        with self.nurse.request(priority=-1) as req:\n            yield req\n\n            print (f\"{self.env.now:.2f}: The nurse is now on a break and will be back at\",\n                    f\"{(self.env.now + g.unav_time_nurse):.2f}\")\n\n            # Freeze with the nurse held in place for the unavailability\n            # time (ie duration of the nurse's break).

    "text": "Tip\n\n\n\nThe good news is that we will be using some prewritten code to specify our lognormal, and all we will need to know to do this is the mean (average) time for our activity, and the standard deviation (a measure of how much the times vary across the dataset that python can calculate for us if given a list of activity times).\nHowever - it’s useful to have a bit more of an idea about what a lognormal is - so do have a read of the section below, but if you don’t quite get it just yet, don’t fret - just remember that lognormal is good for activity times in general, and the exponential distribution is good for inter-arrival times (the time between patients arriving).\n\n\n\n13.1.1 The normal distribution\nA normal distribution is a bell shaped curve that is symmetrical. It is defined by two parameters : μ (Mu) and σ (Sigma), which represent the mean and standard deviation of the distribution. So it’s easy to plug in such values from our own data.\n\n\n\n13.1.2 Logarithms\nBefore we proceed, let’s remind ourselves about something many of us learned at school (and then promptly forgot) : Logarithms.\nLogarithms are basically the opposite of exponentials.\nEffectively, lognormals relate to how many copies of one number multiply together to make another number.\nHow many 4s multiply together to make 64?\n4 x 4 x 4 = 64 We had to multiply 3 copies of the number 4 to get 64.\nThis means that the logarithm is 3.\nWe’d write this as \\[\nY = log_4(64) = 3\n\\]\n\n\n13.1.3 Bringing it all together - lognormal distributions\nHow does this relate to the distribution?\nWell, a Lognormal distribution is one in which the logarithm of the random variable we’re modelling is normally distributed.\nThis means that the the two parameters μ (Mu) and σ (Sigma) used to specify a Lognormal distribution do not represent the mean and standard deviation, unlike the normal distribution; rather, they represent what are known as the location and scale of the distribution respectively.\n\nμ (Mu) and σ (Sigma) represent the mean and standard deviation once the data in the log normal distribution has been transformed using logarithms.\n\nIt’s easy to get the mean and standard deviation of our data.\nIf we used the Normal distribution, we could do that.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWarning\n\n\n\nThe Normal distribution often isn’t good for activity times - it allows negative values - activity distributions are rarely symmetrical - they’re more likely to be a bit ‘wonky’ (skewed), with just a few activities being much longer\n\n\nThe probalm is we can’t just give a Lognormal distribution the mean and standard deviation, because in a Lognormal distribution, the mean and standard deviation of our data is represented in the underlying normal distribution not the Lognormal distribution (remember, it’s the logarithms of the values that are normally distributed).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\nSo what do we do?\nWe need to convert our mean and standard deviation values (that we get from our real world data) into Mu and Sigma for a Lognormal distribution.\nThis is the key bit you need to understand!",

If they waited, we’ll proceed as before. If they reneged, then they won’t see the nurse, and we’ll record that they reneged - We’ll add the number of patients that reneged to our outputs from each run, and take the average number of patients who reneged per run over the trial.",

    "text": "15.2 Balking\nFor balking, there are two different ways in which balking can occur (and both could occur in the same model) :\n\nAn entity may choose not to join a queue because it is too long for their preferences / needs\nAn entity may not be able to join a queue because there is no capacity for them\n\nWe will look at the latter, but the way we approach it is the same for both - the only difference is that, in the former, the maximum queue length is likely to be an attribute of the patient (and may be individual per patient) just like in the reneging example, rather than an attribute of the model.\nHere, we’ll imagine that in our clinic, there is only space for 3 people to wait to see the nurse, and if there is no space, they cannot wait.\nTo model our balking requirements, we will : - Add a parameter to g class to store the maximum queue length allowed (if this were patient-decided balking, we’d put this in the patient class instead) - Add a list to our model attributes that will store all the patient objects currently in the queue for the nurse. This is really useful as it allows us to see who is in the queue at any time, as well as how many etc - Whenever a patient joins or leaves the queue, we’ll update the list of patients in the queue - Before we ask for the nurse resource, we’ll first check if the queue is at maximum size. If it is, the patient will never join the queue and we’ll record that. If not, we’ll proceed as before. We’ll add results of number of patients who balked to our results\n\n15.2.1 Coding a balking example\n\n15.2.1.1 The g Class\nWe’ll add a parameter value that will store the maximum length of the queue we allow for the nurse.\nLet’s imagine there’s only space for 3 people in the waiting room and so no more than 3 people can wait at any time.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nNote - we could simulate balking from the perspective of the patient instead (or as well) - e.g. the patient will only wait if there are no more than x people waiting etc. If we did this, we’d probably want to make this level an attribute of the patient, as it may vary between patients.\n\n\n\nclass g:\n    # Inter-arrival times\n    patient_inter = 5\n\n    # Activity times\n    mean_n_consult_time = 6\n    sd_n_consult_time = 1\n\n    # Resource numbers\n    number_of_nurses = 1\n\n    # Resource unavailability duration and frequency\n    unav_time_nurse = 15\n    unav_freq_nurse = 120\n\n    ##NEW\n    max_q_nurse = 3\n\n    # Simulation meta parameters\n    sim_duration = 2880\n    number_of_runs = 100\n    warm_up_period = 1440\n\n\n\n15.2.1.2 The Patient Class\nThis class is unchanged.\n\n\n15.2.1.3 The Model Class\n\n15.2.1.3.1 The init method\nHere we add in an additional attribute to count the number of people who balk.\nWe also we add a list that will store patient objects queuing for the nurse consultation.

    "text": "15.3 Jockeying\nTrue jockeying involves entities switching from one queue to another, typically because they make a decision that they will likely be seen faster if they do.\nIn over 13 years, the author has never used jockeying to model a healthcare system. SimPy documentation does not cover it either and makes a point of saying they won’t (which implies it’s complicated, though fundamentally you’d need a model of the behaviour in making that decision combined with removing the entity from one queue and placing it in another).\nThere are likely to be few systems that you will model that would use jockeying. However, you might encounter systems where entities pick which queue to join in the first place based on queue length (eg patients deciding which Minor Injury Unit or Emergency Department to attend based on live waiting time data online).\nFor that reason, the example here will be based on this kind of model.\n\n15.3.1 A ‘choosing queues’ example\nLet’s imagine a slight change to our nurse clinic model.\nLet’s imagine that, as well as the nurse, there is also a doctor that patients can see that offers the same service. Patients can choose to join whichever queue they prefer - and they do this by joining the nurse queue if it’s shorter (and the nurse has capacity), and otherwise joining the doctor’s queue.\nThe doctor’s queue has no limits on capacity, and the doctor does not take a break (or rather, there is always a doctor available).\nConsultation times with the doctor are slightly shorter on average (5 mins vs 6 mins for the nurse), but more variable (with a standard deviation of 3 mins vs 1 min for the nurse).\nWe’re also going to imagine that word has got out that there’s now a doctor available too, and demand has more than doubled - patients are now arriving at the clinic every 2 minutes on average, compared to an average of every 5 minutes before.\nDue to the new logic, there should never be any patients balking (as they’d join the doctor’s queue if the nurse queue is full, and the doctor’s queue doesn’t have a capacity constraint), but we’ll still record these numbers so we can check that.\n\n\n15.3.2 Coding the ‘choosing queues’ example\nThe full code can be seen below.\nThis example brings together code for -

We’ll just modify it to add in a space to add a scenario name.\n\nclass g:\n    patient_inter = 5\n    mean_reception_time = 2\n    mean_n_consult_time = 6\n    mean_d_consult_time = 20\n    number_of_receptionists = 1\n    number_of_nurses = 1\n    number_of_doctors = 2\n    prob_seeing_doctor = 0.6\n    sim_duration = 600\n    number_of_runs = 2\n    scenario_name = 0 ## New\n\nLet’s now create all of the scenario objects.\n\nresults = []\n\nfor index, scenario_to_run in enumerate(all_scenarios_dicts):\n    g.scenario_name = index\n\n    # Overwrite defaults from the passed dictionary\n\n    for key in scenario_to_run:\n        setattr(g, key, scenario_to_run[key])\n\n    my_trial = Trial()\n\n    # Call the run_trial method of our Trial object\n    results.append(my_trial.run_trial())\n\npd.concat(results).groupby(\"scenario\").mean().head(20)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\naverage_inter_arrival\nnum_recep\nnum_nurses\nnum_doctors\naverage_reception_time\naverage_nurse_time\naverage_doctor_time\nprob_need_doctor\nArrivals\nMean Q Time Recep\nMean Q Time Nurse\nMean Q Time Doctor\n\n\nscenario\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n0.0\n4.0\n1.0\n1.0\n2.0\n2.0\n6.0\n10.0\n0.6\n144.0\n1.099929\n133.505891\n0.676479\n\n\n1.0\n4.0\n1.0\n1.0\n2.0\n2.0\n6.0\n10.0\n0.8\n144.0\n1.099929\n105.505442\n1.263302\n\n\n2.0\n4.0\n1.0\n1.0\n3.0\n2.0\n6.0\n10.0\n0.6\n144.0\n1.099929\n129.216818\n0.014072\n\n\n3.0\n4.0\n1.0\n1.0\n3.0\n2.0\n6.0\n10.0\n0.8\n144.0\n1.099929\n107.602443\n0.147246\n\n\n4.0\n4.0\n1.0\n1.0\n4.0\n2.0\n6.0\n10.0\n0.6\n144.0\n1.099929\n129.216818\n0.000000\n\n\n5.0\n4.0\n1.0\n1.0\n4.0\n2.0\n6.0\n10.0\n0.8\n144.0\n1.099929\n95.026033\n0.032971\n\n\n6.0\n4.0\n1.0\n2.0\n2.0\n2.0\n6.0\n10.0\n0.6\n144.0\n1.099929\n5.215946\n2.477255\n\n\n7.0\n4.0\n1.0\n2.0\n2.0\n2.0\n6.0\n10.0\n0.8\n144.0\n1.099929\n7.497472\n1.842969\n\n\n8.0\n4.0\n1.0\n2.0\n3.0\n2.0\n6.0\n10.0\n0.6\n144.0\n1.099929\n4.266968\n0.592513\n\n\n9.0\n4.0\n1.0\n2.0\n3.0\n2.0\n6.0\n10.0\n0.8\n144.0\n1.099929\n9.260408\n0.089449\n\n\n10.0\n4.0\n1.0\n2.0\n4.0\n2.0\n6.0\n10.0\n0.6\n144.0\n1.099929\n5.405535\n0.063385\n\n\n11.0\n4.0\n1.0\n2.0\n4.0\n2.0\n6.0\n10.0\n0.8\n144.0\n1.099929\n8.370422\n0.015803\n\n\n12.0\n4.0\n1.0\n3.0\n2.0\n2.0\n6.0\n10.0\n0.6\n144.0\n1.099929\n0.833707\n1.786491\n\n\n13.0\n4.0\n1.0\n3.0\n2.0\n2.0\n6.0\n10.0\n0.8\n144.0\n1.099929\n0.871273\n2.689420\n\n\n14.0\n4.0\n1.0\n3.0\n3.0\n2.0\n6.0\n10.0\n0.6\n144.0\n1.099929\n1.155603\n0.142991\n\n\n15.0\n4.0\n1.0\n3.0\n3.0\n2.0\n6.0\n10.0\n0.8\n144.0\n1.099929\n0.697876\n0.615490\n\n\n16.0\n4.0\n1.0\n3.0\n4.0\n2.0\n6.0\n10.0\n0.6\n144.0\n1.099929\n0.925463\n0.009072\n\n\n17.0\n4.0\n1.0\n3.0\n4.0\n2.0\n6.0\n10.0\n0.8\n144.0\n1.099929\n0.540083\n0.186033\n\n\n18.0\n4.0\n2.0\n1.0\n2.0\n2.0\n6.0\n10.0\n0.6\n144.0\n0.091630\n134.540431\n0.676479\n\n\n19.0\n4.0\n2.0\n1.0\n2.0\n2.0\n6.0\n10.0\n0.8\n144.0\n0.091630\n106.515917\n1.263302\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFinally the following will give you a nice dictionary of all of your scenarios.\n\npd.DataFrame.from_dict(all_scenarios_dicts)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\npatient_inter\nmean_reception_time\nmean_n_consult_time\nmean_d_consult_time\nnumber_of_receptionists\nnumber_of_nurses\nnumber_of_doctors\nprob_seeing_doctor\n\n\n\n\n0\n4\n2\n6\n10\n1\n1\n2\n0.6\n\n\n1\n4\n2\n6\n10\n1\n1\n2\n0.8\n\n\n2\n4\n2\n6\n10\n1\n1\n3\n0.6\n\n\n3\n4\n2\n6\n10\n1\n1\n3\n0.8\n\n\n4\n4\n2\n6\n10\n1\n1\n4\n0.6\n\n\n...\n...\n...\n...\n...\n...\n...\n...\n...\n\n\n1291\n12\n3\n14\n20\n2\n3\n2\n0.8\n\n\n1292\n12\n3\n14\n20\n2\n3\n3\n0.6\n\n\n1293\n12\n3\n14\n20\n2\n3\n3\n0.8\n\n\n1294\n12\n3\n14\n20\n2\n3\n4\n0.6\n\n\n1295\n12\n3\n14\n20\n2\n3\n4\n0.8\n\n\n\n\n1296 rows × 8 columns",
