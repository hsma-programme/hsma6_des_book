**Reproducibility** refers to the ability to get the same results (e.g. those described in a report) using the same code and data. You may have come across the related concept of a **reproducible analytical pipeline (RAP)**, which is when an analytical process (in this case, running and analysing our DES model) is automated and reproducible - from getting the parameters through to generating tables and figures.

Making your work reproducible is important because it:

* **Ensures results can be regenerated** - that future you - or others - can reproduce the results.
* **Builds trust** - through transparency, and confidence in the model's consistency.
* **Saves time and effort** - troubleshooting non-reproducible code in the future can be time-consuming or impossible if key details are missing.
* **Facilitates reuse** - it is necessary for someone reusing the model to ensure it is running correctly, before adapting and applying it to new contexts.
* **Improves code quality** - striving for reproduciblity will in turn encourage clear structure, documentation and organisation, helping reduce errors and ambiguities.

In @sec-reproducibility, we explored how to add **seeds** to our model, allowing us to control randomness and reproduce the same results between runs. However, the requirements for making your work reproducible actually extend beyond that...

## Making your work reproducible

There are various recommendations of best practice, that will help make your work reproducible. We will turn to two relevant examples:

Heather, A. Monks, T. Harper, A. (2025). Mustafee, N. Mayne, A. **On the reproducibility of discrete-event simulation studies in health research: an empirical study using open models**. arXiv pre-print. <https://doi.org/10.48550/arXiv.2501.13137>.

## View recommendations

These recommendations were developed following attempts to reproduce results from healthcare discrete-event simulation models in eight published articles, using the provided code.

The recommendations marked with a star (⭐) were identified as having the greatest impact in Heather et al. 2025.

For further explanation of each recommendation, check out the paper: <https://doi.org/10.48550/arXiv.2501.13137>.

The specific version of the framework copied below is that from commit [2549256](https://github.com/NHSDigital/rap-community-of-practice/commit/2549256498886d6d7ea4cdb736e2a2864c8bb461) (9th September 2024).

🥉 Baseline: RAP fundamentals offering resilience against future change.

* [ ] Data produced by code in an open-source language (e.g., Python, R, SQL).
* [ ] Code is version controlled (see [Git basics](https://nhsdigital.github.io/rap-community-of-practice/training_resources/git/introduction-to-git/) and [using Git collaboratively](https://nhsdigital.github.io/rap-community-of-practice/training_resources/git/using-git-collaboratively/) guides).
* [ ] Repository includes a README.md file (or equivalent) that clearly details steps a user must follow to reproduce the code (use [NHS Open Source Policy section on Readmes](https://github.com/nhsx/open-source-policy/blob/main/open-source-policy.md#b-readmes) as a guide).

## Implementing these recommendations

To demonstrate how to implement these recommendations, an open book has been developed:

> Heather, A., Monks, T., Mustafee, N., & Harper, A. (2025). **DES RAP Book: Reproducible Discrete-Event Simulation in Python and **R. <https://github.com/pythonhealthdatascience/des_rap_book>.

[![DES RAP Book](images/des_rap_book.png)](https://github.com/pythonhealthdatascience/des_rap_book)

This book provides a **step-by-step guide for building discrete-event simulation (DES) models as part of a reproducible analytical pipeline (RAP)**. It follows the principles outlined in:

* ✅ Heather et al. (2025).
* ✅ NHS Levels of RAP Framework.

The book walks through repository set-up, model development, analysis workflows, documentation practices and more. Examples are provided in both Python and R.

Example repositories complement the book by providing fully implemented DES models - the python examples are:

* [pydesrap_mms](https://github.com/pythonhealthdatascience/pydesrap_mms) - a simple synthetic queueing system where patients arrive, wait to see a nurse, undergo a consultation, and then leave.

* [pydesrap_stroke](https://github.com/pythonhealthdatascience/pydesrap_stroke) - implementation of a published stroke model simulating patient pathways.
