In this section weâ€™ve looked at how we can implement the following DES features in SimPy :
- Simulation warm-up
- Priority-based queuing
- Resource unavailability
- Use of the alternative distributions
- Reneging
- Balking
- Entities choosing queues based on queue length

Design and build a DES model in SimPy that uses **at least four of the features above**.

The model can be of anything you like - you may choose to try to build the conceptual model you designed in the DES Design exercise at the end of section 1, or you might choose something completely different.
