# (Coming Soon!) Waiting for One or The Other

:::{.callout-warning}
This section is a work in progress
:::

Sometimes in a system you may find yourself in a situation where you need to

For example, you may have

- an operating theatre where the operation will be cancelled if a recovery bed resource is not available within a certain time of the patient beginning to be prepped
- an air ambulance where the call will be regarded as 'missed' and exit the system if an air ambulance resource is not immediately available

This is really just a similar situation to reneging - but instead of using a patience attribute, we instead provide some other value - often a fixed period of time - to check against.

:::{.callout-note}
Code for this example is coming soon.

In the meantime, take a look at the [reneging](https://des.hsma.co.uk/reneging_balking_jockeying.html#the-attend_clinic-method) section - in particular the use of the OR statement in the form of the `|` (pipe).
