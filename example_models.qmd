Looking at the model code written by other people - even if it does not exactly match the kind of system you are trying to create - can be hugely beneficial for seeing new approaches. In this section are links to a range of additional SimPy models that you might wish to read through and adapt.

:::{.callout-note}
The majority of these models do not use the HSMA structure of `g`, `Patient`, `Model` and `Trial`.

You may find it a helpful exercise to try and convert some of the models linked to the structure we have used in this book so far. This will help you really understand what is going on in the model, and help you to start develop your own preferred structure.

When working through these models, consider:

- What do you prefer about the HSMA structure?
- What do you prefer about the structure the other modeller uses?
- Have they chosen to use a single entity class or multiple entity classes? Can you understand their reasoning for their decision?
- Have they chosen to use a single generator or multiple generators for their patients? Can you see benefits or problems with their chosen approach?

## HSMA clinic model diagram

To aid understanding of different code structures, diagrams have been provided for each example. For comparison, we have generated a diagram of the code structure for the model from @sec-reproducibility. In this model, patients see a patient, nurse and doctor.

## A queueing model

A SimPy model of a queueing model for a nurse consultation.

The repository includes a document [docs/hsma_changes.md](https://github.com/pythonhealthdatascience/rap_template_python_des/blob/main/docs/hsma_changes.md) which explains how the model differs from those in this book, and why those changes were made.

## An urgent care call centre model

A SimPy model of an urgent care call centre where patients speak to an operator, are triaged, and some required callback from a nurse.
