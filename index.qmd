The content in this book is a combined effort, bringing together the knowledge of the Peninsula Collaborative for Operational Research and Design (PenCHORD) on the topic.

The content in part 1 and a large amount of part 2 is from a series of sessions given on discrete event simulation as part of the HSMA programme. These lectures and accompanying code examples were written by [Dr Daniel Chalk](https://github.com/hsma-chief-elf) [![ORCID ID](images/orcid.png)](https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4165-4364) and made available under the **CC BY-NC-SA 4.0** licence. The chapters often replicate the wording of these lectures nearly exactly, with minor tweaks and additions for readability and to better suit the format of a book made by [Sammi Rosser](https://github.com/Bergam0t) [![ORCID ID](images/orcid.png)](https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9552-8988).

The content in parts 3 and 4 is more of a mixture of content from the HSMA lectures along with brand new content written for this book mostly by [Sammi Rosser](https://github.com/Bergam0t) [![ORCID ID](images/orcid.png)](https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9552-8988), with a few pages also by [Amy Heather](https://github.com/amyheather) [![ORCID ID](images/orcid.png)](https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6596-3479). The book also draws on a range of work done by other members of the PenCHORD team, including: [Tom Monks](https://github.com/TomMonks) [![ORCID ID](images/orcid.png)](https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2631-4481), [Mike Allen](https://github.com/MichaelAllen1966) [![ORCID ID](images/orcid.png)](https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8746-9957), and [Anna Laws](https://github.com/aselaws) [![ORCID ID](images/orcid.png)](https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2145-0487).
